Here are the notes I am taking during the lectures of the degree in [Astrophysics and Cosmology](http://astrophysics-and-cosmology.dfa.unipd.it/) at the university of Padua (in the theoretical curriculum).

Also, one can find some notes for other courses (quantum optics, astronomy) and projects I did in this period, these are generally of lower quality than the ones for the main degree.

They are divided by semester and class: the current semester folder is `ap_third_semester`, containing notes for:
* [Astrostatistics and Cosmology](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP8082722/N0): notes are mostly reviewed, a folder can be found for the exercises as well;
* [Compact Object Astrophysics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP9086349/N0): reviewed notes;
* [Cosmology of the Early Universe](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081761/N0): reviewed notes.

In the folder `ap_second_semester` one can find notes for the following courses:
* [Gravitational physics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081719/N0): finished reviewing notes, the last parts are quite short but the big conceptual bits are all there;
* [Theoretical physics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP7081638/N0): reviewed notes, some exercises are missing but on the whole they should be quite complete;
* [Theoretical cosmology](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP9086384/N0): yet to review notes;
* [Astroparticle physics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081703/N0): reviewed notes, but they are not of great quality;
* [Radiative processes in astrophysics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP9086347/N0): finished reviewing notes, there are still a few non-clarified doubts but I think they are generally complete;
* Gravitational Wave Astrophysics (PhD course): yet to review notes.

In the folder `ap_first_semester` one can find notes for the following courses:
* [Advanced astrophysics](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/001PD/SCP9086382/N0): reviewed notes for everything;
* [Astrophysical (high energy) laboratory](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP9086379/A1302): not really coherent notes;
* [Mathematical and numerical methods](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081661/N0): not really coherent notes: the ones by the professor are already comprehensive, my solutions for the exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/jacopok/python-testing/tree/master/numerical_methods);
* [General Relativity](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP7081661/N0): reviewed everything, exercises included;
* [Fundamental of Astrophysics and Cosmology](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2019/LM/SC/SC2490/000ZZ/SCP9086381/N0): I finished reviewing, they will be checked by the professor as well.

Disclaimer: unless specified, **these notes were not reviewed by anyone but me**, so they might contain errors, inaccuracies, typos and so on. Please do not rely on them alone.

In every class folder there is a main file but the individual lectures are kept in a separate file for each day, labelled with the date.
These can be compiled individually (with `pdflatex` for the first semester, `lualatex` for the second), but the resulting PDFs are ignored by git to have some order: only the main PDF for each class is committed here; I should remember to compile it often but sometimes it might be out of date.

Also, in the `ap_first_semester` folder the `main` pdfs are hardlinked to pdfs with more descriptive names, they are automatically synced so you can use either.

This repo is also synced with an Overleaf folder, however I think it is best if that one is kept private.

The idea for these notes is that they will be complete if somewhat untidy, while in the revision phase I will try to make them into a customized explanation, which will be put in the repository [Handbooks](https://github.com/jacopok/handbooks).

Besides the lecture notes, solutions for the exercises (for now, in the General Relativity class) are also present in this repository. Some python visualization of parts of the exercises will also be present when applicable, thanks to [Alessandro Lovo](https://github.com/AlessandroLovo).
Corrections and work on the exercises and notes is also done with the collaboration of Giorgio Mentasti.

Any observations, suggestions and corrections are welcome.
They can be submitted as issues or pull requests here, or by sending an email at jacopo@tissino.it, or just by sending me a message.
