\section*{Tue Dec 10 2019}

We continue with the evolution of a \(15 M_{\odot}\) star. 
Due to the mechanism of neutrino production described last lecture, after a few tens of thousands of years after the start of carbon burning we have an iron core, since the burning was sped up.
The evolution of the envelope is decoupled from that of the core: the process is too fast to affect it. Therefore, the position of the star in the HR diagram is unchanged.

We use Kippenhahn diagrams: in these, we have age on the \(x\)-axis and the mass coordinate on the \(y\)-axis. We can then show how the placement of the different regions of the star's interior evolves.
We can, for example, have the negative logarithm of the time until the core's collapse of the star on the \(x\)-axis.
There can be different burning stages simultaneously, in different shells. 

\subsection{Stellar winds in massive stars}

Stellar winds are of general application in the study of stellar evolution. 

We have \textbf{radiation driven winds} for OB-type stars and Blue Supergiants: these are very hot massive stars.
So, we have lots of UV absorption from resonance transitions in the spectral lines of Fe, O, Si, C.

This leads to high asymptotic velocities \(v_{ \infty } \sim \SI{4e3}{km/s}\) and high mass loss rates \(\dot{M} \sim \SI{5e-5}{} M_{\odot} / \SI{}{yr}\). 
There is a dependence on metallicity like \(\dot{M} \sim Z^{\num{.6}}\).
CAK theory deals well with these.

For red supergiants, instead, we have 
\textbf{dust driven winds}: the mass loss rates can be very high, as much as \(\num{e-4} M_{\odot} / \SI{}{yr}\).
Stars with masses lower than \(40 M_{\odot}\) spend a long time in the core-Helium burning phase as red supergiants: they have time to shed their outer layers; they are then observed as Wolf-Rayet stars, which are the very hottest.

\subsection{Advanced burning stages}

There are four major burning phases: 
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Carbon;
    \item Neon;
    \item Oxygen;
    \item Silicon.
\end{enumerate}

The central burning region forms a convective core.
Burning in external shells forms convective shells.
After a certain type of fuel is locally exhausted, the burning shifts outward.
This gives rise to a so-called ``onion-skin'' model.

\subsection{Wolf-Rayet stars}

\subsubsection{The Humphrey-Davidson limit}

As discussed in the last section, very luminous stars shed their outer layers: this is a plausible explanation of the empirical \emph{Humphrey-Davidson Limit}, an upper limit on the luminosity of red supergiant stars: it is found at around \(M _{\text{bol}} \approx -9.5 \divisionsymbol -10 \) for stars cooler than \SI{15}{kK}.\footnote{\url{http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1979ApJ...232..409H}}

The relation between bolometric magnitude and visual magnitude is: 
%
\begin{align}
  M _{\text{bol}} = -2.5 \log L + 4.73
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the luminosity is measured in solar luminosities. 
Then, the limit can be stated as saying that there are no red supergiants with \emph{visual} luminosities larger than \(\SI{e5.8}{}L_{\odot}\).

This limit depends on the effective temperature of the star, and it is a sharper bound than the Eddington luminosity.

The Eddington luminosity is calculated by setting
%
\begin{align}
  \Gamma_{\text{Edd}} = \frac{a _{\text{rad}}}{g} = \frac{\kappa L _{\text{Edd}}}{4 \pi R^2 c} \frac{R^2}{GM} =1
\,,
\end{align}
%
which implies 
%
\begin{align}
  L _{\text{Edd}} = \frac{cGM 4 \pi }{\kappa_e}
\,.
\end{align}

It can be interpreted as a generalized Eddington limit: if the luminosity is higher the outer layers of the star are shed.
Stars near the limit are unstable: they periodically undergo intense mass loss events, and are known as Luminous Blue Variables.

\subsubsection{Wolf-Rayet stars}

Wolf-Rayet stars have high effective temperatures (\(T > \SI{e4.8}{K}\)) and high luminosities, they expel a great quantity of mass through stellar winds. 

The spectra of WR stars exhibit emission lines: we see little or no \ce{H}, and an abundance of either \ce{He + N} or \ce{C + O}.

We distinguigh them into 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item WNL stars have some hydrogen on the surface (but its mass fraction is lower than \num{.4}) and lots of \ce{H} and \ce{Ne};
    \item WNE are similar but with no hydrogen;
    \item WC stars have no hydrogen, little \ce{N} and more \ce{He}, \ce{C} and \ce{O};
    \item WO stars are similar but with more oxygen.
\end{enumerate}

These are actually evolutionary stages: the outer layers are successively stripped by winds, and the inner ones are exposed.

We observe lots of \ce{^{14}N} in WNE stars, since the Nitrogen burning phase is the slowest process. 

% We have these stars when \(\log T _{\text{eff}} > 4\), and \(M > 30 M_{\odot}\).

\subsection{Final fates by mass}

Depending on the mass of the progenitor red supergiant, we have different behaviours: below \(30 M_{\odot} \) the star explodes as a red supergiant; more massive stars will experience more mass loss and explode as blue supergiants, further left on the HR diagram. 

Here is the general progress of the evolution of stars with \(M > 30 M_{\odot}\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \(30 M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 35 M_{\odot}\) stars go from Red SuperGiants to WNL stars;
  \item \(35 M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 40 M_{\odot}\) stars go from Red SuperGiants to WNL stars to WNE stars;
  \item \(40 M_{\odot} \lesssim M \lesssim 60 M_{\odot}\) stars go from Red SuperGiants to WNL stars to WNE stars to WCO stars;
  \item \(60 M_{\odot} \lesssim M \) stars go from WNL stars to WNE stars to WCO stars;
\end{enumerate}

We see a simulation: a \(15 M_{\odot}  \) star starts off on the high part of the Main Sequence, then quickly moves right becoming a red supergiant when its core collapses.

A \(3 M_{\odot}\) star instead moves away from the MS more slowly, and then after having moved right it quickly moves far left and cools, as a white dwarf. 

\subsection{The collapse of the iron core}

Now, let us discuss the engine of the explosion of these massive stars. The explosion is triggered by an implosion: we are at the end of the Silicon-burning phase. 
The pressure of the iron core is mantained by the degenerate electrons. 

The degenerate iron core starts off with density \(\rho \approx
\SI{e9}{g cm^{-3}}\), temperature \(T \approx \SI{e10}{K}\), mass \(M _{\text{Fe}} \approx \num{1.5} M_{\odot}\) and radius \(R \approx \SI{8000}{km}\). 

What triggers the collapse of the iron core? 

In order to study its dynamical instability, we nee to look at the adiabatic exponent:
%
\begin{align}
  \gamma _{\text{ad}} = \qty(\pdv{\log P}{\log \rho })_{\text{ad}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
we have a dynamica instability when  \(\gamma _{\text{ad}}\) falls below the critical value of \(4/3\). 
It is a local quantity, it can be defined for each layer; we can use a global parameter to measure the instability: 
%
\begin{align}
  \int \qty(\gamma _{\text{ad}} - \frac{4}{3}) \frac{P}{\rho } \dd{m}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which will tell us whether the system as a whole is stable. 
This is effecively an integral over the work of the pulsation: \(\rho^{-1} \dd{m} = \dd{V}\), so \(P/\rho \dd{m} = \dd{W}\).

We have two processes which are opposed: the first is \textbf{photodisintegration}, a process like 
%
\begin{align}
\ce{^{56}_{26}Fe} + \gamma \rightarrow 
13 \ce{^{4}_{2}He} + 4n
\,,
\end{align}
%
in which a heavy nucleus is shattered into \(\alpha \) particles. This is an \emph{endothermic} process.

There is a very important weak process: electron capture, or \emph{neutronization}: \(\ce{p+ + e- \rightarrow n +} \nu_{e}\). This decreases the electron pressure!

The Chandrasekar mass scales as the square of the mean molecular weight: 
%
\begin{align}
  M _{\text{ch}} = \frac{5.83}{\mu_{e}^2} \sim 1.26 M_{\odot}
\,
\end{align}
%
for the iron core. A huge amount of neutrinos are produced. 
Now we follow a work by Janka et al (2007) at the Max Planck, which outlines the steps of the collapse. 

As the density of the core increases, it becomes opaque to neutrinos: we have the scattering cross section 
%
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\nu } \approx \num{e-49} A^2 \qty(\frac{\rho }{\mu_{e}})^{2/3} \SI{}{cm^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and in the meantime the collapse is proceding, until it reaches values of \(\rho \sim \SI{e14}{g cm^{-3}}\), comparable to the nuclear density, at which point the material becomes incompressible. 

A proto-neutron star is formed, and a shock front travels back. 

\todo[inline]{What triggers the initial infall and compression in the first place? }

It is unclear whether the energy of the shock is enough to blow off the envelope. The energy of the delayed neutrinos which are still trapped in the nucleus will contribute\dots

Now we start an interesting new part: the advanced burning stages, after the \ce{He}-burning phases. 

As the initial mass increases, the fraction of carbon produced decreases from around \num{.35} to \num{.15} as \(M\) goes from 10 to 120 solar masses. 

What about the density structure in the pre-supernova phase? 
The starting mass of the iron core increases with the stellar mass: as it goes from 10 to 120 solar masses it goes from 1.2 to 1.8 solar masses. 

As the total mass increases, at a fixed radius we have more internal mass: the density \emph{increases} with mass. 

Some of the material near the core, when the shock occcurs, falls back on it if it is inside a certain critical radius, if it is outside that radius it is thrown out. 
How much of it depends on the physical properties of the core. 

What does the remnant look like? It can either be a black hole or a neutron star. The possibilities 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explosion and Neutron Star;
    \item Implosion and Black Hole;
    \item (rarely) Explosion and Black Hole.
\end{enumerate}

There is no clear-cut law. One thing to look at is the bounce-compactness parameter: 
%
\begin{align}
  \xi_{M^*} = \abs{\frac{M^{*} / M_{\odot}}{R(M^{*}) / \SI{e7}{m}}}_{t = t _{\text{bounce}}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and it seems like this paramter being high is correlated to a black hole being formed. 
We have also the parameter 
%
\begin{align}
  \mu_{4}  = \abs{\frac{ \dd{m} / M_{\odot}}{ \dd{\tau } / \SI{e7}{m}}}_{s=4}
\,,
\end{align}
%
the normalized mass inside a dimensionless entripy per nucleon of \(s=4\). 
We can make a plot of the various final fates of the parts of the initial mass: some of it is expelled by winds, some of it is expelled through the supernova explosion, some of it ends up in the final remnant.

The mass of the iron core is never very much larger than a couple of solar masses, but BHs can become more massive through fallback. 

Then it seems that WR stars of more than \(30 M_{\odot}\) will not explode: they will not eject material as supernovas. 

\todo[inline]{Simulations show that there is not a clear-cut boundary between neutron star and BH formation, but then we go on as if there were\dots}

The behaviour of LA89 massive stars is quite different, NS are more favoured towards higher masses.
