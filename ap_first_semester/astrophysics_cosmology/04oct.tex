% From yesterday we recall that \(k=0\) iff \(\rho (t) = \rho_C(t)\).

% We can write \(H (t_0) = H_0 = 100 h \times \SI{}{\kilo\metre\per\second\per\mega\parsec} \).
% Do note that \(\SI{1}{\mega\parsec} = \SI{3.086e22}{\metre}\).

% If we have \(H\) we can find \(\rho_{0C} = h^2 \times \SI{1.88e-28}{\gram\per\cubic\metre}\). We have defined \(\Omega(t) \defeq \rho / \rho_C\): recall that \(\sign{\Omega -1} = \sign k\).

% So we want to measure the energy density in galaxies to figure out what \(\Omega\) is.

The Schechter function is an empirical estimate for the shape of this distribution:
%
\begin{equation}
  \Phi(L) = \frac{\Phi^*}{L^*} \qty(\frac{L}{L^*})^{-\alpha} \exp(-\frac{L}{L^*})
  \,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(\Phi_{*}\), \(L_{*}\) and \(\alpha \) are parameters, with dimensions of respectively a number density, a luminosity and a pure number.

These can be fit by observation: we find \(\Phi^* \approx \SI{e-2}{} h^3 \SI{}{\mega\parsec^{-3}}\), \(L^* \approx \num{e10}h^{-2} L_\odot \) and \(\alpha \approx 1\).

\label{fig:Schechter}
\end{figure}

The integral for \(\mathscr L_g\) converges despite the divergence of \(\Phi(L)\) as \(L \rightarrow 0\), since it is multiplied by \(L\): so we do not need to really worry about the low-luminosity divergence of the distribution.

The result of the integral for a generic value of \(\alpha \) is \(\mathscr L_g = \Phi^* L^* \Gamma(2-\alpha)\), where \(\Gamma\) is the Euler gamma function; for the \(\alpha = 1\) case we get a factor \(\Gamma(2-1) = 1\).

Numerically, we get \(\mathscr{L}_{g} \approx \num{e8} h L_\odot \SI{}{\per\cubic\mega\parsec}. \) 
\todo[inline]{This is reported incorrectly in \cite{Pacciani:2018} as \(\sim \num{e18}\)! The correct figure can be found in \cite[eq. 4.5.14]{LucchinColes:2002}.
I do not think there is much of a point in reporting the specific value, since the parameters are already given as order-of-magnitude estimates.}

Now, we must estimate \(\expval{M / L}\).
The luminosity of galaxies can be measured readily, the great difficulty lies in estimating their mass.

\subsection{Estimating the masses of galaxies}

We must distinguish between the different shapes of the galaxies: spiral galaxies are characterized by rotation of the stars about the galactic center, while in elliptical galaxies the stars' motion is disordered.

\subsubsection{Spiral galaxies}

If we see a spiral galaxy edge-on, we will have a side of it coming in our direction, and the other side moving away from us (after correcting for other sources of Doppler shift, such as the velocity of the whole galaxy).
So, using the Doppler effect we can measure the distribution of the velocity in the galaxy as a function of the radius. 

% We plot the velocity of rotation of galaxies \(v\)  against the radius \(R\).

In order to get a theoretical model, we can approximate the galaxy as a sphere: this is very rough (spiral galaxies are closer to being disk-like), but it gives the same qualitative result, so there is no need for a more precise model in this context.

We model the galaxy velocity distribution using Newtonian mechanics: the GR corrections are negligible at these scales, galaxies are much larger than their Schwarzschild radii.

Equating the gravitational force \(GM/R^2\) to the centripetal acceleration \(v^2 /R\) we find: 
%
\begin{align}
v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(v\) and \(M\) are functions of \(R\): \(M\) is the mass contained in the spherical shell of radius \(R\), and \(v\) is the orbital velocity at the boundary of the shell.

In the inside regions of the galaxy, where \(M(R) \propto R^3\) since the density is approximately constant we will have \(v \propto R\), while in the outskirts of the galaxy \(M(R)\) will not change much, since all the mass is inside, so we will have \(v \propto R^{-1/2}\).

Our prediction is then a roughly linear region, and then a region with \(v \sim R^{-1/2}\).
This is shown as the ``Predicted'' curve in figure \ref{fig:dark_matter}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Dark_matter.pdf}
\caption{Predicted and observed velocity distribution for galaxies. The point at which they star to diverge is approximately the radius of the bulk of the galaxy. This plot is approximate, realistic models do not have such sharp corners.}
\label{fig:dark_matter}
\end{figure}  

Instead of this, when in the 1980s people started to be able to measure this curve accurately  we see the linear region and then \(v(R)\) is approximately constant. Is Newtonian gravity wrong?

An option is MOND: they propose that there is something like a Yukawa term at Megaparsec distances. They are wrong for some other reasons.

Another option is that what we thought was the galaxy, from our EM observations, is actually smaller than the real galaxy. We'd need mass obeying \(M (R) \sim R\): since \(M(R) = 4 \pi \int_0^{R_{\text{max}}} \dd{R} R^2 \rho(R)\), we need \(\rho(R) \propto R^{-2}\). This is a \emph{thermal} distribution (?): we call it the \emph{dark matter halo}.

People tend to believe that this matter is made up of beyond-the-standard-model particles, like a \emph{neutralino}.
An alternative is the \emph{axion}.

The total density of DM is \(\sim 5\) times more than that of regular matter.

If galaxies are not spiral, we look at other things: the Doppler broadening of spectral lines gives us a measure of the RMS velocity.

\subsection{Virial theorem}

Later in the course we will obtain the (nonrelativistic) virial theorem:

\begin{equation}
  2T + U = 0
\end{equation}

This holds when the inertia tensor stabilizes.

The kinetic energy is \(T = \frac[i]{3}{2} M \expval{v_r^2} \): we expect the radial velocity to account for one third of total energy by equipartition.
\(M\) is the total mass of the energy.

The potential energy is \(U = - G M^2 /R\). Substituting this in we get \(3 \expval{v_r^2} = GM/R\).

If we account for the extra DM mass, we get \(\expval{M/L} \approx 300 h M_\odot / L_\odot\).
In order to have \(\Omega = 1\), we'd need 1390.

So measuring the number density of galaxies and their velocities we get a way to measure \(\Omega_0\).

So, only \(5\%\) of the energy budget is given by baryonic matter (not all of which is visible), while around \(27\%\) is dark matter.

In order to comply with observation, it must be:

\begin{equation}
  0.013 \leq \Omega_{\text{b}} h^2 \leq 0.025\,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(\Omega_b\) corresponds to the baryonic density: so the universe \emph{cannot} be made only of baryons.

Dark matter likes ``clumping'': we characterize it by this property.

In the end we have \(\Omega = 1 = \Omega_b + \Omega_{DM} + \Omega_{DE}\) (do note that the value of 1 is measured, not theoretical!)

The Friedmann equation would imply deceleration if \(\rho, P \geq 0\): dark energy seems to have \emph{negative pressure}.

What about radiation? The CMB appears to be Planckian:

\begin{equation}
  \rho_{0 \gamma} = \frac{\sigma_r T_{0 \gamma}^4}{c^2} = \SI{4.8e-34}{\gram\per\centi\metre\cubed}
\end{equation}
%
where \(\sigma_r = \pi^2 k_B^4 / (15 \hbar ^3 c^3)\), while \(\sigma_{SB} = \sigma_r c /4\).

We are going to show that if neutrinos were massless, their temperature would be \(T_\nu = (4/11)^{1/3} T_\gamma\).

However, we know that for sure \(\sum m_\nu \leq \SI{0.12}{eV} \).

We have:
%
\begin{equation}
  \rho_\nu = 3 N_\nu \frac{\expval{m_\nu} }{\SI{10}{eV}} \SI{e-30}{\gram\per\cubic\centi\metre}
\end{equation}
(??? to check)

\subsection{The Hubble law}

It is very simply

\begin{equation}
  v = H_0 d\,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(v\) is the velocity of objects far from us, and \(d\) is their distance from us. Can we derive this from the Robertson-Walker line element?
It was actually derived first by Lemaitre.

We drop the angular part in the FLRW line element (for \(k = 0\)):

\begin{equation}
  \dd{s^2} = c^2 \dd{t^2} - a^2(t) \dd{r^2}
\end{equation}

So the distance \(d = a(t) r\): therefore \(\dot{d} = \dot{a}r = \frac{\dot{a} }{a} d\).   This is Newtonian and rough, but it seems to work.

\begin{definition}[Redshift]
    The redshift \(z\) is defined by
    %
    \begin{equation}
      z = \frac{\lambda_0 - \lambda_e}{\lambda_{e}}\,,
    \end{equation}
    %
    where \(\lambda_0\) and \(\lambda_e\) are the observed and emission wavelengths.
\end{definition}

We can show that \(1+z = a_0/ a_e\). Therefore, \(\nu_o / \nu_e = a_e / a_0\).

So, we can define (?) the luminosity distance:
%
\begin{equation}
  d_L = \sqrt{\frac{L}{4 \pi \ell} } \,,
\end{equation}
%
where \(L\) is the observed luminosity, while \(\ell\) is the apparent luminosity.

How do we relate the luminosity distance and the scale factor? Geometrically we derive:
%
\begin{equation}
  \ell = \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2 a^2} \qty(\frac{a_e}{a_0}) ^2
\end{equation}
%
since we can just integrate over angles the FLRW element: the value of \(k\) does not enter into the equation.
The corrective factor comes from the frequency dependence of energy and the fact that power is energy over time, which also changes.


Therefore:
%
\begin{equation}
  d_L = \frac{a_o^2}{a_e} r = a (1+z) r\,.
\end{equation}
