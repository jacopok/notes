% \section*{Thu Oct 10 2019}
% \marginpar{Thursday\\ 2019-10-10, \\ compiled \\ \today}

% Today at 17 there is a colloquium at Aula Rostagni.

% Next week, also at 17, there is a meeting at San Gaetano (for the general public).

% We just had a Nobel prize in cosmology: he predicted the existence of the CMB, and two in astrophysics, they found the first exoplanet.

% Send the professor an e-mail to get access to his Dropbox folder with many relevant texts.

% We come back to the RW metric:

% \begin{equation}
%   \dd{s^2} = c^{2} \dd{t^{2}} - a^2(t) \qty(\frac{\dd{r^2}}{1-kr^2} + r^2 \dd{\Omega^2})\,,
% \end{equation}
% %
% where \(k=0, \pm 1\) and \(r\) is the dimensionless comoving radius.

Another way of defining a distance is the one we get by directly integrating the radial part of the line element: this way, we are effectively using a space-like measuring stick, working at fixed cosmic time and fixing both of the angles \(\theta \) and \(\varphi \).

% The distance can be calculated as:
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   d_P (t) = a(t)\frac{r}{\sqrt{1-kr^2}}\,.
% \end{equation}

% We are allowed to consider radial trajectories, however this does not account for the fact that we cannot actually measure with a space-like measuring stick.

\begin{definition}[Proper distance]
The proper distance \(d_P\) at a fixed cosmic time \(t \) to an object at a comoving radial coordinate \(r\) is given by: 
%
\begin{equation}
d_P = a(t) \int_0^r \frac{\dd{\widetilde{r}}}{\sqrt{1-k \widetilde{r}^2}}\,.
\end{equation}
\end{definition}
  
% This is called the \emph{proper distance} (the subscript \(P\) is for ``proper''): the integration, at zero \(\dd{\Omega}\) and zero \(\dd{t}\), of the radial part of the metric.

% On the other hand (OTOH), the flux of photons can give us the \emph{luminosity distance}, which is actually measurable.

\subsubsection{A derivation of the Hubble law}

We want to derive the Hubble law (\(v = H_0 d\)) mathematically.
It can also be restated as \(cz = H_0 d\): the observed velocity of recession of the objects is measured through redshift, which is described (in  the nonrelativistic limit\footnote{The relativistic expression is 
%
\begin{align}
1 + z = \sqrt{\frac{1 + v/c}{1 - v/c}} \gtrsim 1+ \frac{v}{c}
\,.
\end{align}

This will not be relevant for our discussion, however, since before the special-relativistic corrections become relevant we will need to use general-relativistic corrections: roughly speaking, the effects of spacetime expanding while the photon travels from its source to us. 
})
by the formula 
%
\begin{align}
\lambda _0 = \lambda _{e} \qty(1 \pm \frac{v}{c})
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the sign in the \(\pm\) is a plus if the object is receding from us.
We also defined \(z\) through \(\lambda_0 / \lambda_{e}  = 1+z\): this means that we can identify \(z = v/c\).

% For a fixed source at \(d = ar\), naïvely we would have:
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   \dot{d} = \dot{a} r = \frac{\dot{a} }{a} ar = H_0  d
% \end{equation}

Now, we are going to ``move away from the current epoch by Taylor expanding'':
the scale factor at a time \(t\), \(a(t)\), can be written as
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    a(t) &= a_0 + \dot{a}_0 (t-t_0 ) + \frac{1}{2} \ddot{a}_{0}(t-t_0)^2 + \mathcal{O}\qty(\abs{t-t_0}^3)
    \marginnote{We drop the error term}\\
    &\approx a_0 \qty(1 + H_0 (t-t_0 ) - \frac{1}{2} q_0 H_0 ^2 (t-t_0 )^2)\,, \marginnote{Substituted \(H_0 = \dot{a}_{0} / a_0 \).} \label{eq:scale-factor-expansion-second-order}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
where \(q_0 \defeq - \ddot{a}_0 a_0 / (\dot{a}_0 )^2\) is called the \emph{deceleration parameter} for historical reasons: people thought they would see deceleration (\(\ddot{a}<0\)) when first writing this, so a positive \(q_0 \), but
the deceleration parameter is instead measured to be negative.
The Hubble law is only correct up to first order, and we will show this by also calculating the second order correction. 

% (the Hubble \emph{constant} is not constant wrt \emph{time} , but wrt \emph{direction}!)

Now, \(1 + z = a_0 / a\) can be expressed as:

\begin{equation}
    1+ z \simeq \qty(1 + H_0  (t-t_0 ) - \frac{1}{2} q_0 H_0 ^2 (t-t_0 )^2)^{-1}\,.
\end{equation}

Do note that this is derived starting with a formula which is correct up to second order in the time interval \(\Delta t = t - t_0 \): when expanding we cannot trust terms of order higher than second.
Expanding with this in mind we get:\footnote{We need to compute the first and second derivatives of 
%
\begin{align}
\qty(1 + H_0 \Delta t - \frac{q_0}{2} H_0^2 \Delta t)^{-1}
= \qty(1 + a \Delta t + b \Delta t)^{-1} = f(\Delta t)
\,:
\end{align}
%
they are 
%
\begin{align}
\dv{f}{\Delta t} &= - \qty(1 + a \Delta t + b \Delta t)^{-2} \qty(a + 2 b \Delta t)  \\
\dv[2]{f}{\Delta t} &= 2\qty(a + 2b \Delta t)^2 \qty(1 + a \Delta t + b \Delta t) - \qty(1 + a \Delta t + b \Delta t)^{-2} \qty(2 b)
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we have 
%
\begin{align}
\eval{\dv{f}{\Delta t} }_{\Delta t = 0} = x
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
\frac{1}{2!}\eval{\dv[2]{d}{\Delta t}}_{\Delta t = 0} = \frac{1}{2!} \qty(2 a^2- 2b) = a^2 - b
\,.
\end{align}}
%
\begin{equation}
  1+ z \simeq
  1 - H_0 \Delta t + \frac{q_0 }{2} H_0^2 \Delta t^2 + H_0^2 \Delta t^2\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore
%
\begin{align}
  z &= H_0 (t_0 - t) + \qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2}) H_0^2 (t_0 - t)^2 \marginnote{Changed the time intervals to \(t_0 -t = - \Delta t\), the square of which is the same as before.}  \\
  &= (t_0 - t) \qty[H_0 + \qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2})H_0^2(t_0 - t) z]
  \,.
\end{align}

Bringing the bracket to the other side we get
%
\begin{align}
  t_0 - t &= z \qty[H_0 + \qty(1+\frac{q_0}{2})H_0^2 (t_0 -t)]^{-1}  \\
  &= z \qty[H_0 + \qty(1+\frac{q_0}{2})H_0 z]^{-1}  \\
  &= \frac{z}{H_0}  \qty[1+ \qty(1+\frac{q_0}{2}) z]^{-1}
  \,,
\end{align}
%
where we substituted the first order expression \(t_0 -t = z/ H_0 \): we are allowed to make this substitution since the expression is multiplied by \(z\), which has the same asymptotic order as \(t_0 -t\) (since \(H_0 \) is finite): working to first order inside the brackets is equivalent to working to second order in the global expression.

By the same reasoning, we can expand the inverse bracket to first order: 
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:time-difference-wrt-redshift}
t_0 - t = \frac{z}{H_0 } \qty[1 - \qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2} z)]
= \frac{z}{H_0 } - \qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2}) \frac{z^2}{H_0 }
\,,
\end{align}
%

% As before, when we expand we keep only the relevant orders:
% %
% \begin{equation}
%   t_0 - t = H_0 (t_0 - t) + \qty(1+ \frac{q_0}{2}H_0^2 (t_0 - t)^2)
% \end{equation}

We would like the time interval to disappear: we want a distance, not a time, so we should seek an expression for \(r\) instead of \(\Delta t\).
We are observing photons, for which \(\dd{s^2} =0\), which is equivalent \(c^2 \dd{t^2} = a^2 (t) \dd{r^2} / (1-kr^2) \).
Taking a square root and integrating we get:
\begin{equation}
\int_{t}^{t_0 } \frac{c \dd{t}}{a(t)}
= \pm \int_r^0 \frac{\dd{\widetilde{r}}}{\sqrt{1-k \widetilde{r}^2}}
\,,
\end{equation}
%
where we should select the negative sign since we want positive quantities on both sides. The other choice would correspond to the photon being emitted from the Earth and received at the comoving radius of the source. 

The integral on the right hand side can be solved analytically: it is 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:integral-radial-FLRW}
-\int_{r}^{0} \frac{ \dd{\widetilde{r}}}{\sqrt{1 - k \widetilde{r}^2}} =
\begin{cases}
  \arcsin r =r + \mathcal{O}(r^3) &k =1 \\
  r  &k=0 \\
  \operatorname{arcsinh} r =r + \mathcal{O}(r^3)\qquad\qquad  &k= -1
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
in all cases, it is just \(r\) up to \emph{second} order (since the next term in the expansion of an arcsine or hyperbolic arcsine is of third order).

On the left hand side, we can substitute in \(a(t)\) from equation \eqref{eq:scale-factor-expansion-second-order}:
\begin{align}
\int_{t}^{t_0} \frac{c\dd{t}}{a(t)} 
&= \frac{c}{a_0 }
\int_{t }^{t_0 } \dd{\widetilde{t}} \qty[1 + H_0 (\widetilde{t} - t_0) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta \widetilde{t}^2)]^{-1}  \\
&= \frac{c}{a_0 } \qty[t_0  - t + \frac{H_0}{2} \qty(t-t_0 )^2] + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3)
\end{align}
%
where we used the expression for the scale factor to first order only since the integration raised the order of the estimate by one.
we have:
\begin{align}
\frac{c}{a_0 } \qty((t_0 - t) + \frac{1}{2} H_0 (t_0 - t)^2 + \mathcal{O}(\Delta t ^3)) &= r  
\,,
\end{align}
%
since the term proportional to \(q_0 \) only gives a third order contribution.
We can now substitute the expression for the time difference with respect to the redshift \eqref{eq:time-difference-wrt-redshift}, only computed to second order: 
%
\begin{align}
r &= \frac{c}{a_0 } \qty[\frac{z}{H_0 } \qty(1 -\qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2})z)+ \frac{H_0 }{2} \qty(\frac{z}{H_0 } \qty(1 -\qty(1 + \frac{q_0}{2})z))^2]  \\
&= \frac{c}{a_0 } \qty[\frac{z}{H_0 } - \qty(1+\frac{q_0}{2})\frac{z^2}{H_0 } + \frac{H_0}{2} \frac{z^2}{H_0^2}] \marginnote{Ignored the third and higher order terms in the square.}  \\
&= \frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \qty[z - \frac{1}{2} \qty(1 + q_0 )z]
\,.
\end{align}
%

Now, we can insert this expression for \(r\) into the formula for the luminosity distance \eqref{eq:luminosity-distance}:
\begin{align}
d_L &= a_0^2 \frac{r}{a} = a_0 (1+z) r \\
&= a_0 (1+z) \frac{c}{a_0 H_0 } \qty(z - \frac{1}{2} (1+ q_0 )z^2)
\,.
\end{align}

As we expect, the term \(a_0 \) disappears: it is a bookkeeping parameter, the physical properties of a universe described by a FLRW metric are invariant under a global rescaling of the scale factor.

Our expression also contains cubic terms in \(z\): removing these to get back to second order we find
\begin{align}
d_L &= \frac{cz}{H_0} 
\qty(1+z) \qty(1- \frac{1}{2}\qty(1+q_0)z)  \\
&= \frac{cz}{H_0 } \qty(1 + \qty( 1 - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}q_0 )z)  \\
&= \frac{cz}{H_0 } \qty(1 + \frac{1}{2}\qty(1 - q_0) z)
% \qty(z + \frac{1}{2} (1-q_0 ) z^2)
\,.
\end{align}

We can turn this into a relation for \(cz\) in terms of \(d_L\) by substituting in the first order expression \(d_L H_0 = cz\) into the second order term (the error we make by this approximation is of third order at least):
\begin{align}
cz &= d_L H_0 + \frac{q_0 -1}{2} cz^2 \\
cz &= H_0 \qty(d_L + \frac{1}{2} (q_0 -1 ) \frac{H_0}{c} d_L^2)\,,
\end{align}
%
and we can notice that the relation is approximately linear and independent of acceleration for low redshift, but we can detect the acceleration at higher redshift.
Typically we need to measure galaxies at least \SI{10}{\mega\parsec} away in order to detect these second order effects.
As we mentioned in the beginning, the data show the parameter \(q_0 \) to be negative.

This effect is similar to a Doppler effect, but the analogy is not perfect: the redshift is caused by the expansion of space itself, and the apparent velocities of the galaxies at high redshift would be superluminal. 

\subsubsection{Interpretation of superluminal recession velocities}

What follows is a synthesis of the enlightening article by Davis and Lineweaver \cite[]{davisExpandingConfusionCommon2004}, which should be referred to for clarification.

The proper way to define velocities is directly through the metric: so, we will need to differentiate the relation \(d = a \chi \), where \(\chi \) is the distance in comoving coordinates and \(d\) is the physical distance, with respect to the cosmic time. This yields \(\dot{d} = \dot{a} \chi = H d\).
Note that we are assuming that the object is stationary with respect to the comoving coordinates (\(\dot{\chi} = 0\)), so we are ignoring what is called the \emph{peculiar velocity}. 

This \(\dot{d}\) is precisely the recession velocity, and this definition can be extended to any redshift. As written it is quite implicit, since we do not know what the distance in comoving coordinates is to an object we observe with redshift \(z\). This will be treated in section \ref{sec:measuring-distances}, but for now the result is (see also the aforementioned paper \cite[eq. 1]{davisExpandingConfusionCommon2004}, and an older paper by Harrison \cite[eq. 13]{harrisonRedshiftdistanceVelocitydistanceLaws1993}) that the velocity now of an object observed with redshift \(z\) is
%
\begin{align}
v _{\text{rec}} = H_0 d_C(z) = c H_0  \int_{0}^{z} \frac{ \dd{\widetilde{z}}}{H(\widetilde{z})}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which can be greater than \(c\): doing the computation allows us to see that \(v>c\) for \(z \gtrsim 1.5\).\footnote{An interesting (although meaningless) fact: the current recession velocity of the CMB (\(z \approx 1090\)) is around \(\num{3.14} c \approx \pi c\), according to the latest Planck data \cite[]{PlanckCollaboration:2016XIII}. For more details on how the recession velocity scales with the redshift, see figure 2 in Davis \& Lineweaver \cite[]{davisExpandingConfusionCommon2004}.} 

Does this result contradict General, or even Special Relativity? 
It does not!
In General Relativity we cannot directly compare velocities of objects which are far away from each other: they lie in different vector spaces, and there can be no local inertial frame extending that far.
So, it is consistent to have superluminal recession velocities, while observers near the emission, as well as observers near Earth, always measure velocities locally to be \(\leq c\). 

Now we can clear some common misconceptions: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item recession velocities can indeed exceed the speed of light;
  \item they can do so in periods of ``regular'' expansion of the universe: we did not consider inflation, which surely did not occur for \(z \sim 1.5\), which is the point at which the recession velocities start being superluminal;
  \item we can indeed see the light from objects which are currently receding superluminally: the formula for the comoving distance is derived by integrating a photon's trajectory. 
\end{enumerate}

% \todo[inline]{The reasoning in \cite{Pacciani:2018} is not completely convincing: extrapolating a superluminal velocity from \(cz \sim 10c\) is meaningless, since these formulas were derived in the nonrelativistic approximation. If we use the correct relativistic formula for the Doppler shift this issue does not arise. We might be able to show that the apparent speed of high-redshift galaxies is superluminal but we need another way to do it. (Decisamente hai ragione, aggiungi poi che la relazione vale per z piccolo e 10 non è piccolo solitamente. Ad ogni modo ha ragione a dire che il rate di espansione potrebbe essere maggiore di c senza creare problemi alla relatività)}

\begin{definition}[Angular diameter distance]
The angular diameter distance is defined as the ratio of the object's physical transverse size \(L\) to its angular size in radians \(\Delta \theta \): 
%
\begin{align}
d_A = \frac{L}{\Delta \theta } = a(t) r
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is peculiar in that it is not monotonic in \(z\) \cite{hoggDistanceMeasuresCosmology2000}: at \(z \gtrsim 1\) it starts decreasing.
\end{definition}

% We can do better than that if we go from \emph{cosmography} to \emph{cosmology}, by understanding what causes the acceleration of the expansion of the universe.

\subsubsection{Redshift-scale factor relation}

Let us prove the statement from before, \(\lambda_0 / \lambda  = a_0 / a\):
photons are emitted with a certain wavelength \(\lambda_{e}\), at a comoving radius \(r\) from us, and detected at \(\lambda_{o}\).

The line element for the photon is \(\dd{s^2} =0\), therefore \(c\dd{t}/ a(t) = \pm \dd{r} / \sqrt{1-kr^2} \).

As before, we can integrate this relation from the emission to the absorption: we call it \(f(r)\) (it can be any of the functions shown in equation \eqref{eq:integral-radial-FLRW}):
\begin{equation}
  \int_{t}^{t_0 } = \frac{c\dd{\widetilde{t}}}{a(\widetilde{t})} = f(r)
\end{equation}

If we map \(t \rightarrow t + \delta t\) and \(t_0 \rightarrow \delta t_0 \) in the integration limits, the integral must be constant since it only depends on \(r\) --- do note that all the expansion of the universe is accounted for by the increasing scale factor, objects are stationary with respect to the comoving radial coordinate \(r\).
We are computing the integral for two successive wavefronts of the light.
Then, we equate the two: 
%
\begin{align}
f(r) &= \int_{t}^{t_0 } \frac{c \dd{\widetilde{t} }}{a(\widetilde{t})} = \int_{t+\delta t}^{t_0 + \delta t_0 } \frac{c \dd{\widetilde{t} }}{a(\widetilde{t})}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which we can split into: 
%
\begin{align}
\qty[\int_{t+ \delta t}^{t} + \int_{t}^{t_0} + \int_{t_0 }^{t_0 + \delta t_0 } - \int_{t}^{t_0 }] \frac{c \dd{\widetilde{t}}}{a(\widetilde{t})} = 0
\,,
\end{align}
%
where, since all the integrals have the same argument, we collect it at the end for clarity.
We simplify the original integral and swap the integration limits to get:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{t}^{t + \delta t} \frac{c\dd{\widetilde{t}}}{a(\widetilde{t})} = \int_{t_0 }^{t_0 + \delta t_0 } \frac{c\dd{\widetilde{t}}}{a(\widetilde{t})}\,,
\end{equation}
%
which can we approximate by
\begin{equation}
\frac{c \delta t}{a(t)} =   \frac{c \delta t_0 }{a(t_0 )}\,,
\end{equation}
%
since the periods of the photons we are considering are generally much smaller than the cosmic timescales.

Since the frequency of the emitted and observed photons must be proportional to the inverse of the time intervals \(\delta t\) or \(\delta t_0 \), we have
\begin{equation}
  \nu_{e} a(t_{e}) = \nu_{o} a(t_{o})\,,
\end{equation}
%
therefore 
%
\begin{equation}
  1 + z = \frac{\lambda_{o}}{\lambda_{e}}
  = \frac{a_0 }{a}\,.
\end{equation}

\chapter{Friedmann models}

The Friedmann equations describe the dynamical evolution of the universe, as opposed to the static description given by the FLRW metric.

\section{A Newtonian derivation of the Friedmann equations}

The Friedmann equations are derived starting from the Einstein Field Equations for the FLRW metric, however we can derive them using an almost purely Newtonian argument.

We will not be able to recover the full equations, since a Newtonian fluid's pressure is \(P \ll \rho c^2\): its contribution to the stress-energy-momentum tensor is negligible \cite[eqs. 441--443]{tissinoGeneralRelativityNotes2020}.
So, through our argument we will recover the equations we would have with \(P=0\).

The only non-Newtonian step in our derivation is the justification of the Newtonian approximation: we wish to make use of the theorem attributed to Birkhoff, but first derived by the Norwegian physicist J.T. Jebsen \cite[]{johansenDiscoveryBirkhoffTheorem2005}.

\begin{proposition}[Jebsen-Birkhoff]
The only solution to the vacuum Einstein Field Equations which is spherically symmetric is given by the Schwarzschild metric \cite[sec. 32.2]{misnerGravitation1973}:\footnote{This is not relevant for what we will discuss here, but do note that there is no requirement of the generating (internal) mass distribution to be static: this is, in fact, the reason why spherically symmetric collapsing or pulsating stars cannot emit  gravitational waves.}
%
\begin{align}
\dd{s^2} =  \qty(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r}) c^2 \dd{t^2} 
- \qty(1 - \frac{2GM}{c^2r})^{-1} \dd{r^2} - r^2 \dd{\Omega^2}
\,.
\end{align}
\end{proposition}

With this in mind, let us take a spacetime with uniform density \(\rho\).
We consider a sphere, and imagine taking all the mass inside the sphere away.
% Then, by Birkoff's theorem, 

% \todo[inline]{It is claimed in \cite[]{Pacciani:2018} that it is a corollary of the  JB theorem that the metric inside a spherical shell is Minkowski, this was not obvious to me so I looked for a reference. 
%  actually claims that this is false, and that the metric inside the shell is indeed a slice of Schwarzschild spacetime but not necessarily with \(M=0\), and their reasoning seems to make sense.}

By the Jebsen-Birkhoff theorem, the internal geometry of this shell is only determined by the mass distribution inside the shell: since we took all the mass inside the sphere away, the inside spacetime is Minkowski, that is, Schwarzschild spacetime with \(M=0\).\footnote{There is actually some nuance to this: as is expounded upon in an article by Zhuang and Yi \cite{zhangCOMMONMISUNDERSTANDINGBIRKHOFF2012}, in general relativity the geometry inside the shell is actually influenced by the presence of the shell, in that its time coordinate is different to the one which would be measured by an outside observer. This is relevant, for instance, if we wish to compute the Shapiro delay of a ray of light passing through the shell and coming back out.
This is not an issue for us, since the geometry on the inside is locally indistinguishable from a pure vacuum Minkowski spacetime if we measure only inside the shell.}

% This can also be applied to a hole: in this case, it tells us that the metric inside the cavity is the Minkowski metric.

We describe this system through a mass coordinate: \(M(\ell)\) is the mass enclosed by a spherical shell of radius \(\ell\).

The mass taken away will be \(M(\ell) = \frac{4 \pi}{3} \rho \ell^{3}\), where \(\vec{l} = a(t) \vec{r}\) is the radius of the sphere, whose norm is \(\ell = \abs{\vec{l}}\), and \(\rho \), as mentioned before, is the constant density.

We suppose that the gravitational field is \emph{weak}: this is quantitatively expressed using the relation \(\ell \ll r_g\), where \(r_g\) is the Schwarzschild radius of the system: this relation becomes
%
\begin{equation}
  \frac{GM(\ell)}{\ell c^2} \ll 1\,,
\end{equation}
%
and is a necessary assumption in order to apply a Newtonian approximation.

Now, we ``put back'' the mass which was removed, in order to restore the initial situation.

We put a test mass on the surface of the sphere. What is the motion of the mass due to the gravitational field from the center? It will surely be radial, and since as we said we are in the Newtonian approximation we can calculate it using Newton's equation: 
%
\begin{equation} \label{eq:newtonian-approx-acceleration}
\ddot{\ell} = - \frac{GM(\ell)}{\ell^2} = - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \rho \ell
\,.
\end{equation}

This seems to give us a net force even though we expect everything to be stationary because of isotropy.
This is because we are not working in comoving coordinates: the radius of the sphere,  \(\ell\), can change with the scale factor, even when the comoving vector \(\vec{r}\) is constant.

Our final result will not depend on the unit vector we choose.

% there should be none, this is actually not an issue since the unit vectors in our equations will go away in the end.

Plugging in \(\ell = a r\) we find
\begin{align}
  \ddot{a} r &= - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \rho a r \\
  \ddot{a} &= - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} \rho a\,.
\end{align}

This is the second Friedmann equation, \eqref{eq:friedmann-2}, without the pressure term for the reasons mentioned before.

% This is part of a Friedmann equation: the isotropic pressure term cannot be recovered, it's like the speed of light is infinite now.

Starting from the acceleration equation \eqref{eq:newtonian-approx-acceleration} we can get 
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\ell} \ddot{\ell} = - \frac{GM}{\ell^2} \dot{\ell}\,,
  \marginnote{Multiplied by \(\dot{\ell}\)}
\end{equation}
%
and identifying \(2\dot{\ell} \ddot{\ell} = \dv*{(\dot{\ell})^2}{t}\) we find the conservation of energy equation:
%
\begin{align} 
\frac{1}{2} \dv{}{t} \qty(\dot{\ell})^2 &= - \frac{GM\dot{\ell}}{\ell^2} \\ 
 \frac{1}{2} \qty(\dot{\ell})^2 &= -GM \int \frac{1}{\ell^2} \dv{\ell}{t} \dd{t}
 \marginnote{We integrate on both sides in \(\dd{t}\)} \\
  \frac{1}{2}\dot{\ell}^2 &=
  \frac{GM}{\ell}  + C
  =  \frac{4 \pi}{3} G \rho \ell^{2} + C\,, \marginnote{Used \(M = 4 \pi \rho \ell^3 /3 \).}
\end{align}
%
where \(C\) is an arbitrary constant, which we can express in terms of the scale factor:
%
\begin{equation}
  \dot{a}^2 r^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho a^2 r^2 + C
\end{equation}
%
or, removing the \(r^2\) term, which is a constant (since it is a comoving radius, with respect to which objects are stationary),
%
\begin{equation}
\dot{a}^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho a^2 + \frac{C}{r^2}\,.
\end{equation}

Now, the dimensions of this constant are those of a speed, therefore we can express it as \(C / r^2 = -k_N = -k c^2\), where \(k\) is dimensionless --- we are allowed to do this since \(k_N\), the Newtonian curvature constant, has the dimensions of an energy per unit mass, or equivalently a velocity squared.

This clarifies the statement that the magnitude of \(k\) is arbitrary: we get it by dividing the constant \(C\) (which is fixed) by the dimensionless comoving radius, whose magnitude is indeed arbitrary, therefore we can normalize it however we wish: so we choose \(\abs{k} = 1\) or 0.

\begin{bluebox}
The equation we found is of the form: 
%
\begin{align}
E _{\text{kin}} + E _{\text{grav}} = -k c^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(E _{\text{kin}}\) and \(E _{\text{grav}}\) are the energies per unit mass in the form of either kinetic or gravitational energy.
So we can directly see that \(k\), in a sense, describes the \emph{intrinsic} energy of a free, stationary (with respect to the comoving coordinates) test mass.

If it is positive (\(k<0\)) then the particles have an intrinsic positive energy, which causes expansion, while if it is negative (\(k>0\)) it is as if they were intrinsically gravitationally bound, which causes contraction.
\end{bluebox}

% The number \(k\) was badly defined to be only \(\pm 1\) or 0: its newtonian version is much better represented by \(k_N = kc^2\).
