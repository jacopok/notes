% During inflation, the comoving Hubble radius (\(r_H = 1/\dot{a}\)) decreases.
Let us consider a region of radius approximately \(1 / H(t_b)\), where \(t_b\) is a certain moment before the start of the inflationary phase.
This region is expanded by many \(e\)-foldings through inflation, such that any inhomogeneities are smoothed out: this is the \textbf{cosmic no-hair theorem} \cite[pag.\ 159]{LucchinColes:2002}.

% \(t_i\) is the beginning time of inflation, \(t_f\) is its end, \(t_\Lambda \) is the time when the cosmological constant became dominant, and then we get to now: \(t_0 \).

% What happened before inflation?

% The cosmic no-hair conjecture is what allows inflation to delete inhomogeneties.
So, there might have been perturbations before inflation: we cannot know.
Perturbations on scales larger than the cosmological horizon are not perceivable as perturbations: we only perceive our local mean value.

% Below the largest inflation scale, the perturbations are erased by inflation: we see perturbations on these scales which are produced during inflation.

The energy density of radiation through the inflationary period scales as \(\rho _r \propto a^{-4}\), while the one of matter instead it scales as \(\rho _m \propto a^{-3} \propto e^{-3Ht}\) since \(a \propto e^{Ht}\).

The maximum temperature of radiation after inflation is given by the one which corresponds to the maximum latent energy released by our scalar field due to its coupling to the rest of the universe, which acts as a sort of viscous force.

So we get that this latent energy \(\Delta V\) is of the order of \(T^{4}_{\text{rad}}\).
\todo[inline]{This seems like a rather technical point to end on\dots Is there some larger meaning to be drawn from these last paragraphs?}

\section{Baryogenesis}

This is the process which lead to the formation of baryons --- right now baryonic matter is almost exclusively made of protons and neutrons, while in this early phase the temperature was higher than their binding energy, so a quark plasma was able to exist. 
% What is the typical temperature needed to produce baryon symmetry? 

% \todo[inline]{What is baryon symmetry?}

These questions are hard to answer without a grand unification theory.

How much antimatter is there in the universe?
A long time ago, it was thought that there might have been regions in the universe which were filled with antimatter by looking for a \(\gamma \)-ray background, but this was not found.
We did not find them.

The baryon number is the difference between the number of baryons and antibaryons: \((n_b - n_a) / (n_b + n_a)\). This is actually computed with quark numbers, so it can be computed even when protons and neutrons have not yet formed.

It seems like the only antimatter known is the one which was formed by us, or cosmic rays.

The value \(\Omega_{0b} \approx 0.04\) is defined as 
%
\begin{align}
  \rho_{0b} = \Omega_{0b} \rho _{c} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(\rho_c = 3 H_0^2 / (8 \pi G)\).

When we define the number of protons in the universe we also fix the number of neutrons, since the universe is globally neutral.
So we can estimate: 
%
\begin{align}
  n_{0b} = \frac{\rho_{0b}}{m_p} \approx \SI{1.12e-5}{cm^{-3}} \times h^2 \Omega_{0b}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where \(h \sim 0.7\),
and similarly we can compute 
%
\begin{align}
  n_{0 \gamma } \approx \SI{420}{cm^{-3}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we can 
look at the baryon to photon number ratio: 
%
\begin{align}
  \eta_0  = \frac{n_{0b}}{n_{0\gamma}}
  \approx \num{3e-8} \Omega_{0b} h^2
\,,
\end{align}
%
why does this number have this value? 

The denominator in \((n_b - n_a) / (n_b + n_a)\) is approximately \(2 n_{\gamma }\) then, and both the difference in the numerator and the numerator scale like \(a^{-3}\), so this value is a constant.
We do not see antimatter, therefore \(n_a = 0\). So, we get 
%
\begin{align}
    \frac{n_b - n_a}{n_b + n_a} \approx \frac{n_b}{2 n_\gamma } = \frac{1}{2} \eta_0 
\,.
\end{align}
%
This must then have been the case also in the matter dominated epoch, during which there was a very slight imbalance in baryons vs antibaryons.

In order to generate a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry we need \begin{enumerate}
    \item ?
    \item \(C\) and \(CP\) violation (while \(CPT\) symmetry must hold for any well-behaved QFT);
    \item out-of-equilibrium processes.
\end{enumerate}

These were proposed by a famous Soviet scientist.

We define the interaction rate \(\Gamma \): it is the number of interactions per unit time.

The Hubble rate \(H = \dot{a} / a \) is also an inverse time: baryons and antibaryons are practically speaking \emph{decoupled} if \(\Gamma \leq H\): this is equivalent to saying that the time of interaction is larger than the age of the universe.

When are particles actually coupled or decoupled?
\(\Gamma \) can be calculated as \(\Gamma = n \expval{\sigma v}\), where \(n\) is the number density, \(v\) is the velocity of the particles, and \(\sigma \) is the cross section of the interaction.

We need to distinguish the types of interactions we are dealing with.
In general interactions are carried by gauge bosons. 
Either they are massless (like the photon) or they are massive (like the the \(W^{\pm}\) and \(Z\) bosons, as long we are below the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking \(\sim \SI{e2}{GeV}\)).

At larger energies than those, the weak interaction also becomes long-range.

In the massless case, the cross-section is \(\sigma \sim \alpha^2 / T^2\), where \(g = \sqrt{4 \pi \alpha }\).

In the massive case, for temperatures \(T \leq m_{x}\), the cross section is of the order \(\sigma \sim G_x^2 T^2\).

There is an inversion in the \(T\) dependence between long and short range interactions.

Typically \(G_x = \alpha / m_x^2\).  Then, \(\sigma \sim \alpha^2 T^2 / m_x^{4}\).

This difference is because in general the formula is like 
%
\begin{align}
  \sigma \sim \frac{T^{2}}{E^{4}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we either have \(E \sim m\) in the low-speed case, or \(E \sim T\) in the high-speed case.

So, we know that \(\Gamma = n \expval{\sigma v}\). In the massless case this is something like \(\Gamma \sim T^3 \sigma \sim T^{3} \sim \alpha^2 T\) since \(T \sim 1/ a\).

Then, we get 
%
\begin{align}
  H = \sqrt{\frac{8 \pi G }{3}} g_{*}^{1/2} \qty(\frac{\pi^2}{30})^{1/2} T^2 \sim \frac{T^2}{m _{\text{pl}}}
\,,
\end{align}
%
since \(G \sim 1/m _{\text{pl}}^2\). Then, 
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{\Gamma}{H} \sim \frac{\alpha^2 T m _{\text{pl}}}{T^2} \sim \alpha^2 m _{\text{pl}} \frac{1}{T}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so we have decoupling when \(T > \alpha^2 m _{\text{pl}}\).
Essentially, at temperatures larger than \(T = \SI{e16}{GeV}\) this massless photon is decoupled.

``Above the Planck epoch, even gravitational interactions are decoupled''.

What about the massive interactions? We have \(\Gamma \sim T^2 G_x^2 T^2\), to compare with \(H \sim T^2/ m _{\text{pl}}\): we get 
%
\begin{align}
  \frac{\Gamma}{H} \sim \frac{T^3 G_x^2}{T^2 / m _{\text{pl}}} \sim G_x^2 m _{\text{pl}} T^3 \leq 1
\,,
\end{align}
%
equivalently, \(T < m _{\text{pl}}^{-1/3} G_x^{-2/3}\).

Suppose that we are considering the gravitational interaction: in that case, we get \(T < m _{\text{pl}}\) since \(G_x\) is related to \( G_N\) 

\todo[inline]{What is the relation?}

For the weak interaction, we have 
%
\begin{align}
    T < \qty(\frac{m_x}{\SI{100}{GeV}})^{4/3} \SI{}{MeV}
\,,
\end{align}
%
which is why below \(\SI{1}{MeV}\) neutrinos are decoupled.

Let us now consider the consequences of these decoupling conditions.
First of all we look at the recombination of hydrogen.
At very high temperatures, there are free electrons and free protons.
Protons first appeared in the universe as non-relativistic, at \(T \sim \SI{1}{MeV}\) while \(m_p \sim \SI{1}{GeV}\).

At a certain point, it becomes possible to create neutral H atoms from these free particles.
We will use a special case of the Boltzmann formula, which governs this and many other phenomena: the Saha equation.

The reaction is \(e + p \leftrightarrow H + \gamma \). We want to look at a density in phase space.
We'd need all the scattering matrices, and all the phase space densities of the particles.
The Saha equation is basically an ansatz at thermal and chemical equilibrium: \(\mu _e + \mu_p = \mu_H + \mu_\gamma \). The chemical potential \(\mu \) entered in the exponent of the FD and BE expressions.

We know that \(\mu_{\gamma }=0\).
At thermal equilibrium the number density of the electrons is: 
%
\begin{align}
  n_e = g_e \qty(\frac{m_e T}{2 \pi })^{3/2} \exp(\frac{\mu _e - m_e }{T}) 
\,,
\end{align}
%
and an exactly analogous formula holds for \(n_p\) and \(n_H\): for protons we have 
%
\begin{align}
    n_p = g_p \qty(\frac{m_p T}{2 \pi })^{3/2} \exp(\frac{\mu _p - m_p }{T}) 
  \,.
\end{align}
Degeneracy is not an issue, since we are talking about cosmology.

The number density of photons is given by 
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:n-gamma}
  n_{\gamma } = \frac{2 \zeta (3) T^3}{\pi^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%

The binding energy of the hydrogen is \(B=m_p+m_e-m_H=\SI{13.6}{eV}\). Instead of \(m_H\) we write \(+m_p+m_e-B\). So the number density of hydrogen atoms is given by: 
%
\begin{align}
  n_H = g_H \qty(\frac{m_H T}{2 \pi })^{3/2} \exp(\frac{\mu_p - \mu_e - m_p - m_e + B}{T})
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we can simplify things since \(m_p, m_H \gg m_e, B\), and substitute in the number densities for electrons and protons.
We get approximately
%
\begin{align}
  n_H = \frac{g_H}{g_e g_p} n_e n_p \qty(\frac{m_e T}{2 \pi })^{-3/2}\exp(B/T)
\,,
\end{align}
%
but the universe is locally and globally neutral: \(n_e = n_p\), and \(n_b = n_p + n_H\). 

We will see that most of the hydrogen we produce will not be when the temperature is of the order of the binding energy, but much later.
