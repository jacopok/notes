  abstract = {This paper presents cosmological results based on full-mission \emph{Planck\emph{ observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. Our results are in very good agreement with the 2013 analysis of the \emph{Planck\emph{ nominal-mission temperature data, but with increased precision. The temperature and polarization power spectra are consistent with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter ΛCDM cosmology with a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted “base ΛCDM” in this paper). From the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature data combined with \emph{Planck\emph{ lensing, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, \emph{H\emph{\textsubscript{0\textsubscript{ = (67.8 ± 0.9) km s\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{Mpc\textsuperscript{-1\textsuperscript{, a matter density parameter Ω\textsubscript{m\textsubscript{ = 0.308 ± 0.012, and a tilted scalar spectral index with \emph{n\emph{\textsubscript{s\textsubscript{ = 0.968 ± 0.006, consistent with the 2013 analysis. Note that in this abstract we quote 68\% confidence limits on measured parameters and 95\% upper limits on other parameters. We present the first results of polarization measurements with the Low Frequency Instrument at large angular scales. Combined with the \emph{Planck\emph{ temperature and lensing data, these measurements give a reionization optical depth of \emph{τ\emph{ = 0.066 ± 0.016, corresponding to a reionization redshift of . These results are consistent with those from WMAP polarization measurements cleaned for dust emission using 353-GHz polarization maps from the High Frequency Instrument. We find no evidence for any departure from base ΛCDM in the neutrino sector of the theory; for example, combining \emph{Planck\emph{ observations with other astrophysical data we find \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.15 ± 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, consistent with the value \emph{N\emph{\textsubscript{eff\textsubscript{ = 3.046 of the Standard Model of particle physics. The sum of neutrino masses is constrained to ∑ \emph{m\emph{\textsubscript{\emph{ν\emph{\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.23 eV. The spatial curvature of our Universe is found to be very close to zero, with | Ω\textsubscript{\emph{K\emph{\textsubscript{ | {$<$} 0.005. Adding a tensor component as a single-parameter extension to base ΛCDM we find an upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{{$<$} 0.11, consistent with the \emph{Planck\emph{ 2013 results and consistent with the \emph{B\emph{-mode polarization constraints from a joint analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and \emph{Planck\emph{ (BKP) data. Adding the BKP \emph{B\emph{-mode data to our analysis leads to a tighter constraint of \emph{r\emph{\textsubscript{0.002\textsubscript{ {$<$} 0.09 and disfavours inflationarymodels with a \emph{V\emph{(\emph{φ\emph{) ∝ \emph{φ\emph{\textsuperscript{2\textsuperscript{ potential. The addition of \emph{Planck\emph{ polarization data leads to strong constraints on deviations from a purely adiabatic spectrum of fluctuations. We find no evidence for any contribution from isocurvature perturbations or from cosmic defects. Combining \emph{Planck\emph{ data with other astrophysical data, including Type Ia supernovae, the equation of state of dark energy is constrained to \emph{w\emph{ = −1.006 ± 0.045, consistent with the expected value for a cosmological constant. The standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the helium and deuterium abundances for the best-fit \emph{Planck\emph{ base ΛCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We also constraints on annihilating dark matter and on possible deviations from the standard recombination history. In neither case do we find no evidence for new physics. The \emph{Planck\emph{ results for base ΛCDM are in good agreement with baryon acoustic oscillation data and with the JLA sample of Type Ia supernovae. However, as in the 2013 analysis, the amplitude of the fluctuation spectrum is found to be higher than inferred from some analyses of rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. We show that these tensions cannot easily be resolved with simple modifications of the base ΛCDM cosmology. Apart from these tensions, the base ΛCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the \emph{Planck\emph{ CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}},

  abstract = {A nonrelativistic potential theory for gravity is considered which differs from the Newtonian theory. The theory is built on the basic assumptions of the modified dynamics, which were shown earlier to reproduce dynamical properties of galaxies and galaxy aggregates without having to assume the existence of hidden mass. The theory involves a modification of the Poisson equation and can be derived from a
Lagrangian. The total momentum, angular momentum, and (properly defined) energy of an isolated system are conserved. The center-of-mass
acceleration of an arbitrary bound system in a constant external gravitational field is independent of any property of the system. In other words, all isolated objects fall in exactly the same way in a constant external gravitational field (the weak equivalence principle is satisfied). However, the internal dynamics of a system in a constant external field is different from that of the same system in the absence of the external field, in violation of the strong principle of
equivalence. These two results are consistent with the phenomenological requirements of the modified dynamics. A toy relativistic theory is sketched which has a nonrelativistic limit satisfying the requirements of the modified dynamics.},

To show the abundance of these misconceptions we cite numerous misleading, or easily misinterpreted, statements in the literature. In the context of the new standard Lambda-CDM cosmology we point out confusions regarding the particle horizon, the event horizon, the ``observable universe'' and the Hubble sphere (distance at which recession velocity = c). We show that we can observe galaxies that have, and always have had, recession velocities greater than the speed of light. We explain why this does not violate special relativity and we link these concepts to observational tests. Attempts to restrict recession velocities to less than the speed of light require a special relativistic interpretation of cosmological redshifts. We analyze apparent magnitudes of supernovae and observationally rule out the special relativistic Doppler interpretation of cosmological redshifts at a confidence level of 23 sigma.},

Throughout, the emphasis is on the geometric structure of spacetime, rather than the traditional coordinate-dependent approach. This allows the theory to be pared down and presented in its simplest and most elegant form. Topics covered include flat spacetime (special relativity), Maxwell fields, the energy-momentum tensor, spacetime curvature and gravity, Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, black holes and singularities, and cosmology. In developing the theory, all physical assumptions are clearly spelled out and the necessary mathematics is developed along with the physics. Exercises are provided at the end of each chapter and key ideas in the text are illustrated with worked examples. Solutions and hints to selected problems are also provided at the end of the book. This textbook will enable the student to develop a sound understanding of the theory of general relativity, and all the necessary mathematical machinery.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash{}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash{}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash{}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash{}tau = 0.054\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash{}theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash{}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash{}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash{}sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash{}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash{}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash{}sum m\_\textbackslash{}nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter LCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (theta\_*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the LCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

  abstract = {Early dark energy (EDE) that behaves like a cosmological constant at early times (redshifts \$z\textbackslash{}gtrsim3000\$) and then dilutes away like radiation or faster at later times can solve the Hubble tension. In these models, the sound horizon at decoupling is reduced resulting in a larger value of the Hubble parameter \$H\_0\$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We consider two physical models for this EDE, one involving an oscillating scalar field and another a slowly-rolling field. We perform a detailed calculation of the evolution of perturbations in these models. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo search of the parameter space for the EDE parameters, in conjunction with the standard cosmological parameters, identifies regions in which \$H\_0\$ inferred from \{\textbackslash{}it Planck\} CMB data agrees with the SH0ES local measurement. In these cosmologies, current baryon acoustic oscillation and supernova data are described as successfully as in \textbackslash{}LCDM, while the fit to \{\textbackslash{}it Planck\} data is slightly improved. Future CMB and large-scale-structure surveys will further probe this scenario.},

  abstract = {We use the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to reduce the uncertainty in the local value of the Hubble constant (H\_0) from 3.3\% to 2.4\%. Improvements come from new, near-infrared observations of Cepheid variables in 11 new hosts of recent SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia, more than doubling the sample of SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia having a Cepheid-calibrated distance for a total of 19; these leverage the magnitude-z relation based on 300 SNe\textasciitilde{}Ia at z{$<$}0.15. All 19 hosts and the megamaser system NGC4258 were observed with WFC3, thus nullifying cross-instrument zeropoint errors. Other improvements include a 33\% reduction in the systematic uncertainty in the maser distance to NGC4258, more Cepheids and a more robust distance to the LMC from late-type DEBs, HST observations of Cepheids in M31, and new HST-based trigonometric parallaxes for Milky Way (MW) Cepheids. We consider four geometric distance calibrations of Cepheids: (i) megamasers in NGC4258, (ii) 8 DEBs in the LMC, (iii) 15 MW Cepheids with parallaxes, and (iv) 2 DEBs in M31. H\_0 from each is 72.25+/-2.51, 72.04+/-2.67, 76.18+/-2.37, and 74.50+/-3.27 km/sec/Mpc, respectively. Our best estimate of 73.24+/-1.74 km/sec/Mpc combines the anchors NGC4258, MW, and LMC, and includes systematic errors for a final uncertainty of 2.4\%. This value is 3.4 sigma higher than 66.93+/-0.62 km/sec/Mpc predicted by LambdaCDM with 3 neutrinos with mass 0.06 eV and the Planck data, but reduces to 2.1 sigma relative to the prediction of 69.3+/-0.7 km/sec/Mpc with the combination of WMAP+ACT+SPT+BAO, suggesting systematic uncertainties in CMB measurements may play a role in the tension. If we take the conflict between Planck and H\_0 at face value, one plausible explanation could involve an additional source of dark radiation in the early Universe in the range of Delta N\_eff=0.4-1. We anticipate significant improvements in H\_0 from upcoming parallax measurements.},

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the Hubble constant (\$H\_\{0\}\$) and other cosmological parameters from a joint analysis of six gravitationally lensed quasars with measured time delays. All lenses except the first are analyzed blindly with respect to the cosmological parameters. In a flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, we find \$H\_\{0\} = 73.3\_\{-1.8\}\^\{+1.7\}\$, a 2.4\% precision measurement, in agreement with local measurements of \$H\_\{0\}\$ from type Ia supernovae calibrated by the distance ladder, but in \$3.1\textbackslash{}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This method is completely independent of both the supernovae and CMB analyses. A combination of time-delay cosmography and the distance ladder results is in \$5.3\textbackslash{}sigma\$ tension with \$Planck\$ CMB determinations of \$H\_\{0\}\$ in flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM. We compute Bayes factors to verify that all lenses give statistically consistent results, showing that we are not underestimating our uncertainties and are able to control our systematics. We explore extensions to flat \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM using constraints from time-delay cosmography alone, as well as combinations with other cosmological probes, including CMB observations from \$Planck\$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and type Ia supernovae. Time-delay cosmography improves the precision of the other probes, demonstrating the strong complementarity. Allowing for spatial curvature does not resolve the tension with \$Planck\$. Using the distance constraints from time-delay cosmography to anchor the type Ia supernova distance scale, we reduce the sensitivity of our \$H\_0\$ inference to cosmological model assumptions. For six different cosmological models, our combined inference on \$H\_\{0\}\$ ranges from \$\textbackslash{}sim73\$-\$78\textasciitilde\textbackslash{}mathrm\{km\textasciitilde{}s\^\{-1\}\textasciitilde{}Mpc\^\{-1\}\}\$, which is consistent with the local distance ladder constraints.},

  abstract = {In Newtonian gravity (NG) it is known that the gravitational field anywhere inside a spherically symmetric distribution of mass is determined only by the enclosed mass. This is also widely believed to be true in general relativity (GR), and the Birkhoff theorem is often invoked to support this analogy between NG and GR. Here we show that such an understanding of the Birkhoff theorem is incorrect and leads to erroneous calculations of light deflection and delay time through matter. The correct metric, matching continuously to the location of an external observer, is determined both by the enclosed mass and mass distribution outside. The effect of the outside mass is to make the interior clock run slower, i.e., a slower speed of light for external observer. We also discuss the relations and differences between NG and GR, in light of the results we obtained in this Lettework. Finally we discuss the Generalized Shapiro delay, caused by the outside mass, and its possible laboratory test.},
