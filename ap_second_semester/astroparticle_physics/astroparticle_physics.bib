  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the energy density of the Universe was dominated by radiation between reheating after inflation and the onset of matter domination 54,000 years later. While the abundance of light elements indicates that the Universe was radiation dominated during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is scant evidence that the Universe was radiation dominated prior to BBN. It is therefore possible that the cosmological history was more complicated, with deviations from the standard radiation domination during the earliest epochs. Indeed, several interesting proposals regarding various topics such as the generation of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, gravitational waves, primordial black holes, or microhalos during a nonstandard expansion phase have been recently made. In this paper, we review various possible causes and consequences of deviations from radiation domination in the early Universe - taking place either before or after BBN - and the constraints on them, as they have been discussed in the literature during the recent years.},

There is a good global agreement over a range of nine orders of magnitude between abundances of 4He, D, 3He and 7Li deduced from observations, and calculated in primordial nucleosynthesis.

The precision in deuterium observations in cosmological clouds has recently improved dramatically, so that nuclear cross-sections involved in deuterium BBN needs to be known with similar precision. We will briefly discuss nuclear aspects related to the BBN of Li and D, BBN with nonstandard neutron sources, and finally, improved sensitivity studies using a Monte Carlo method that can be used in other sites of nucleosynthesis.},

  abstract = {Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) describes the production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. We briefly overview the essentials of this physics, and present new calculations of light element abundances through li6 and li7, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors, N\_nu. We review recent developments in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom, n\_eff. These measurements allow for a tight test of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the primordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are consistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N\_nu when combined with the CMB baryon density, and provides a 2sigma upper limit N\_nu {$<$} 3.2. The new precision of the CMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he4, li7 predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics.},

Are we unique, or are we just one of many intelligent species populating the Universe? It is likely that in the vastness of the Universe we humans do not stand alone. Recent surveys have detected thousands of extrasolar planets, many within the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars and consistent with rocky compositions and likely to contain secondary, volcanically outgassed atmospheres. In the near future we might be within reach of other forms of life and maybe of other civilizations; we must understand how to identify them, and, if possible, how to communicate with them. At the basis of all this is understanding what is life, and how it emerged on Earth and maybe elsewhere. The answer to these questions is written in the language of physics.},

Within the standard model, an elegant mechanism, called the Higgs mechanism, accounts for the appearance of masses of particles and of some of the gauge bosons. The standard model is very successful, since it brilliantly passed extremely accurate precision tests and several predictions have been confirmed-in particular, the Higgs particle has been recently discovered in the predicted mass range. However, it can hardly be thought as the final theory of nature: some physics beyond the standard model must be discovered to account for gravitation and to explain the energy budget of the Universe.},

Symmetry plays a particularly important role in particle physics, as it does in astrophysics and in cosmology. The key mathematical framework for symmetry is group theory: symmetry transformations form groups. Although the symmetries of a physical system are not sufficient to fully describe its behavior—for this purpose, one needs a complete dynamical theory—it is possible to use symmetry to discover fundamental properties of a system. Examples of symmetries include space–time symmetries, internal symmetries of particles, and the so-called gauge symmetries of field theories.},

In the late 1990s it has been discovered that neutrinos of different flavors (electron, muon, or tau) “oscillate”: neutrinos created with well-defined leptonic flavor may be detected in another flavor eigenstate. This phenomenon implies that neutrinos have a non-zero—although tiny even for the standards of particle physics—mass.},

  abstract = {We explore the effective degrees of freedom in the early universe, from before the electroweak scale at a few femtoseconds after the Big Bang, until the last positrons disappeared a few minutes later. We first look at the established concepts of effective degrees of freedom for energy density, pressure and entropy density, and introduce effective degrees of freedom for number density as well. We discuss what happens with particle species as their temperature cools down from relativistic to semi- and non-relativistic temperatures, and then annihilates completely. This will affect the pressure as well as the entropy per particle. We also look at the transition from a quark-gluon plasma to a hadron gas. Using a list of known hadrons, we use a "cross-over" temperature of 214 MeV where the effective degrees of freedom for a quark-gluon plasma equals that of a hadron gas.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology.},

In mathematical terms this means the object we are searching for must be a scalar, which is an object transforming according to the (0, 0) representation of the Lorentz group. Together with the restriction to the simplest possible choice this will be enough to derive the correct equations of nature. Nature likes it simple.},
