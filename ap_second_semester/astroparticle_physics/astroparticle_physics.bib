  abstract = {We review sterile neutrinos as possible Dark Matter candidates. After a short summary on the role of neutrinos in cosmology and particle physics, we give a comprehensive overview of the current status of the research on sterile neutrino Dark Matter. First we discuss the motivation and limits obtained through astrophysical observations. Second, we review different mechanisms of how sterile neutrino Dark Matter could have been produced in the early universe. Finally, we outline a selection of future laboratory searches for keV-scale sterile neutrinos, highlighting their experimental challenges and discovery potential.},

  abstract = {How did the laws of physics made it possible that life evolved? How did intelligent life evolve? How come that human beings are here on Earth today? Are we unique, or are we just one of many intelligent species populating the Universe? It is likely that in the vastness of the Universe we humans do not stand alone. Recent surveys have detected thousands of extrasolar planets, many within the circumstellar habitable zones of their host stars and consistent with rocky compositions and likely to contain secondary, volcanically outgassed atmospheres. In the near future we might be within reach of other forms of life and maybe of other civilizations; we must understand how to identify them, and, if possible, how to communicate with them. At the basis of all this is understanding what is life, and how it emerged on Earth and maybe elsewhere. The answer to these questions is written in the language of physics.},

They can be unified by a Lagrangian displaying gauge invariance with respect to the SU(3) \textbackslash (\textbackslash otimes \textbackslash ) SU(2) \textbackslash (\textbackslash otimes \textbackslash ) U(1) local symmetry group; this unification is called the standard model of particle physics. Within the standard model, an elegant mechanism, called the Higgs mechanism, accounts for the appearance of masses of particles and of some of the gauge bosons. The standard model is very successful, since it brilliantly passed extremely accurate precision tests and several predictions have been confirmed-in particular, the Higgs particle has been recently discovered in the predicted mass range. However, it can hardly be thought as the final theory of nature: some physics beyond the standard model must be discovered to account for gravitation and to explain the energy budget of the Universe.},

Symmetry plays a particularly important role in particle physics, as it does in astrophysics and in cosmology. The key mathematical framework for symmetry is group theory: symmetry transformations form groups. Although the symmetries of a physical system are not sufficient to fully describe its behavior—for this purpose, one needs a complete dynamical theory—it is possible to use symmetry to discover fundamental properties of a system. Examples of symmetries include space–time symmetries, internal symmetries of particles, and the so-called gauge symmetries of field theories.},

Due to their low interaction probability, they are very difficult to detect and as a consequence the neutrino sector is the least known in the standard model of particle physics. In the late 1990s it has been discovered that neutrinos of different flavors (electron, muon, or tau) “oscillate”: neutrinos created with well-defined leptonic flavor may be detected in another flavor eigenstate. This phenomenon implies that neutrinos have a non-zero—although tiny even for the standards of particle physics—mass.},
