Last time we saw how to expand the solution into multipole moments, and focused on the quadrupole. 

We finally got, for a GW propagating along \(\hat{z}\): 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
h_{+} &= \frac{1}{r} \frac{G}{c^{4}} \qty(\ddot{M}_{11} - \ddot{M}_{22})  \\
h_{ \times } &= \frac{2}{r} \frac{G}{c^{4}} \ddot{M}_{12}
\,.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

But how do we compute the full angular distribution? 
We can brute-force it using the full \(\Lambda \) projection tensor, but a more conceptual way is to put ourselves in a frame in which the generic vector \(\hat{n}\) is \(\hat{z}\). 
Then we use the rotation matrices: we need two of them, one for each unit vector in a rank-2 tensor \(M_{ij}\). 
Then we use the simple expression for \(h_{+}\) and \(h_{ \times }\), substituting in the \(\ddot{M}_{11}\), \(\ddot{M}_{12}\) and so on in the primed system. 

\begin{enumerate}
  \item There is no monopole radiation: \(\dot{M} = 0\), since mass is conserved.
  \item We can move the origin so that the dipole is zero: \(M^{i} =0 \). This corresponds to linear momentum being conserved: \(\dot{P}^{i}=0\). This is in stark contrast to Electromagnetism: there, we cannot eliminate the dipole radiation. This is due to there being positive and negative electric charges, while there are no negative masses. 
  \item We did not account for back-action: our GWs do not carry ``away'' energy or momentum. This is unphysical, we will account for it!
\end{enumerate}

A stress-energy tensor for a system of point masses looks like 
%
\begin{align}
T^{\mu \nu }(t, \vec{x}) = \sum _{A} \frac{p^{\mu }_{A} p^{\nu }_{A}}{\gamma_{A}  m_{A}} \delta^{(3)} (x - x_{A}(t))
\,.
\end{align}

In order to apply our system, our system must be closed: we cannot consider any particle trajectory, since they must move on geodesics in order to conserve the stress-energy tensor. 

However, we can use the relative coordinate in a self-gravitating system: then we have the relative \(x_0 = x_1 - x_2 \), the total mass \(m = m_1 + m_2 \), the reduced mass \(\mu = m_1 m_2 / (m_1 + m_2 )\), an the center of mass position \(x _{\text{CM}} = (m_1 x_1 +m_2 x_2 ) / (m_1 + m_2 )\). 

If we set the position of the COM to zero identically, we find 
%
\begin{align}
M^{ij} = \mu x^{i}_{0} x^{j}_{0}
\,.
\end{align}

We consider two particles in the XY plane moving on a trajectory, which for now we assign. so that we get 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
x_0 (t) &= R \cos(\omega_{s} t + \frac{\pi}{2}) \\
y_0 (t) &= R \sin(\omega_{s} t + \frac{\pi}{2}) \\
z_0 (t) &= 0
\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
so we find 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\ddot{M}_{11} &= - \ddot{M}_{22} = 2 \mu R^2 \omega_{s}^2 \cos(2 \omega_{s}t)  \\
\ddot{M}_{12} &= 2 \mu R^2\omega_{s}^2  \sin( 2 \omega_{s}t)
\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
which means the GW emission has twice the rotational frequency. 

If we look at emission in a generic direction \(\hat{n}\), described by the angles \(\theta \) and \(\varphi \), we will receive 
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
h_{+} (t, \theta , \varphi ) = \frac{1}{r} \frac{4G \mu \omega_{s}^2 R^2}{c^{4}} \frac{1 + \cos^2\theta }{2} \cos(2 \omega_{s}t _{\text{ret}} + 2 \varphi  ) \\
h_{ \times } (t, \theta , \varphi ) = \frac{1}{r} \frac{4G \mu \omega_{s}^2 R^2}{c^{4}} \cos(\theta ) \sin(2 \omega_{s}t _{\text{ret}} + 2 \varphi  )
\,,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
so the two scale differently as \(\theta \) varies. 

Do note that \(h_{+} + h_{ \times }\) looks like a circular polarization moving counter-clockwise, while \(h_{+} - h_{ \times }\) moves clockwise. This is what we see for \(\theta = 0, \pi \); on the other hand for \(\theta = \pi /2\) we only have \(h_{+}\). 

\todo[inline]{Plot effects! }

Some numbers: the Earth-Sun system, seen \SI{1e5}{lyr} away, has a strain on the order \num{5e-32}. 
Let us try a BNS in our galaxy: we use Newtonian orbits to model the binary. 

Note that the strain is inversely proportional to \(r\): this is because we are not measuring the intensity, but directly the amplitude. 

If we put in the expression for the radius from Kepler's law: we find 
%
\begin{align}
h_{+} \sim h_{ \times } \sim \frac{4 G^{5/3} \omega_{s}^{2/3} \mu M^{2/3}}{r c^{4}}
\,.
\end{align}
%
Let us consider a BNS with masses \(m_1 = m_2 = 1.5 M_{\odot}\) in our galaxy: then, the strain will be  of the order \num{e-20}.

We have seen a BNS outside of our galaxy, at \SI{40}{Mpc} away. 

Do this with GW150914: \(m_1 \sim 36 M_{\odot}\), \(m_2 \sim 31 M_{\odot}\), \(f_s \sim \SI{250}{Hz}\), \(r \sim \SI{440}{Mpc}\).

When their distance becomes too small, we cannot model them using Kepler's laws anymore. 

Now, back-action: we saw no energy loss, which is ``by design'': GW energy is quadratic in \(h\), while our theory is linear. 

Another approach: if our theory is local, it cannot describe the energy of GWs. 
GWs do carry energy, however we cannot describe it in a local way, since for any single particle we can gauge them away. However, we can look at the tidal effects between two particles. 

We need to perform an average in spacetime. 

If we introduce a stress-energy tensor for our GWs, this will curve the background spacetime: then we have 
%
\begin{align}
g_{\mu \nu } = \overline{g}_{\mu \nu } + h_{\mu \nu }
\,,
\end{align}
%
but how do we decide which deviation from flat is part of the background and what is part of \(h\)?

There is no formal way to define this, but we can use a heuristic, based on what they describe. 
We say that the background \(\overline{g}_{\mu \nu }\) varies spatially slowly, across a distance \(L_B\), such that all the GWs we are considering have reduced wavelengths (\(k = \lambda /2 \pi \)) which are smaller than a fixed maximum wavelengths, so that \(\lambda  \leq \lambda_{GW} \ll L_B\). 

This is like distinguishing waves and tides in the ocean: intuitively it is easy to see how they differ, based on the scale of their effects.

We also impose that all the GWs vary much faster than the background, temporally: \(f > f_{GW} \gg f_B\). 
Do not that these two are independent, since while GWs travel at the speed of light\footnote{Which we know to within a part in \num{e-14}.} the background does not. 
We refer to both as the short-wave approximation. 

How do GW detectors then distinguish GW from background? 
If we impose \(f_{GW} = c / \lambda_{GW}\) with \(\lambda_{GW}\) around a kilometer we get \(f \sim \SI{300}{kHz}\). This is not interesting, and technically difficult. 
Also, ground-based detectors do not measure the metric along the length, but only an integrated effect. 

Instead, the detectors monitor local temporal variations of \(g_{\mu \nu } (t, x_0 )\). 
So, our detectors work best between \SI{100}{Hz} to \SI{1000}{Hz}; the Earth's gravitational field is not smooth along the corresponding length scale. However, it's close to static: its variations are slower than a few \SI{}{Hz}.
So, we can apply our distinction: GW and background can be distinguished in frequency.
