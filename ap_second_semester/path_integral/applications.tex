\section{Applications} \label{sec:applications}

% Definitions from \cite[]{matarresePathintegralApproachLargescale1986}. 

% The second connected correlation function, computed with a smoothing at a scale \(R\), can be used to define a variance: \(\xi^{(2)} (x, x) \sim \sigma _R^2\). 
% With this we can then quantify ``peaks'' in the density perturbation \(\delta (x) = (\rho - \expval{\rho }) / \expval{\rho }\). 

% Specifically, we define a function \(\rho_{\nu , R}\) so that it is equal to \(1\) when the perturbation is \(\nu \) sigmas above the average (which is \(\delta = 0\) by definition), and \(0\) otherwise: 
% %
% \begin{align}
% \rho_{\nu , R} = \Theta (\delta (x) - \nu \sigma _R)
% \,.
% \end{align}

% We can define an \(N\)-point correlation for this ``boolean density'': 
% %
% \begin{align}
% \Pi^{(N)}_{\nu , R} (x_1 \dots x_N) = \expval{\prod_{r=1}^{N} \rho_{\nu , R}(x_r)} 
% \,
% \end{align}
% %
% quantifies the probability that the perturbation is above the threshold at all the positions \(x_r\). 
% We then define the \emph{peak} correlation function 
% %
% \begin{align}
% \xi^{(N)}_{\text{dis}, \nu , R} = \expval{\frac{\prod_{r=1}^{N} \rho_{\nu , R} (x_r)}{\expval{\rho_{\nu , R}}^{N} }} - 1
% \,.
% \end{align}

% % \todo[inline]{understand its physical meaning}

% According to equations 16 and 22 in \cite[]{matarresePathintegralApproachLargescale1986} the two-point correlation function with two different smoothing scales and thresholds is allowed to have zero-crossings.  

% \todo[inline]{What does \(\xi_{cc} \propto \xi_{gg}\) mean? These are the two-point correlation functions for rich cluster and galaxies. Do they correspond to \(\xi^{(N)}_{\text{dis}, \nu, R}\) for different values of \(\nu \)? What is the connection between this observable quantity and the mathematical formalism of peak correlation functions?}

% The paper also finds \emph{scaling relations} between a certain order \(N\)-point peak correlation function and lower order ones, as well as the background correlation functions \cite[eqs.\ 24--25]{matarresePathintegralApproachLargescale1986}. 
% The result is interesting since it is general, allowing for the computation to be performed with a general non-Gaussian background; in the Gaussian case it reduces to 
%
% \begin{align}
% \zeta (1, 2, 3) &= \xi (1, 2) \xi (2, 3) + \xi (1, 3) \xi (2, 3) + \xi (1, 2) \xi (1, 3) + \xi (1, 2) \xi (2, 3) \xi (1, 3)  \\
% \zeta &\sim \sum \xi^2 + \xi^3
% \,,
% \end{align}
%
% where \(\zeta \) is the three-point peak correlation function, \(\xi \)is the two point one, and we denote \(x_i \equiv i\) for compactness. 
% The second expression is just a compact form for the first.
% 
% This expression does not seem to fit observational data: specifically, the \(\xi^3\) term has not been found in observations. 
% The aforementioned general expression can be written as 
% %
% \begin{align}
% \zeta = F \qty(\sum \xi^2 + \xi ^3) + (F-1) \qty(1 + \sum \xi ) 
% \,,
% \end{align}
% %
% where \(F = F(1, 2, 3) = 1\) in the Gaussian case. 

% \todo[inline]{I do not understand the motivation behind equation 28 in the same paper? Is it meant to make it so the \(\xi^3\) term vanishes? }

% \todo[inline]{Is the \(\xi^3\) term predicted by Gaussian statistics but not observed?}



% \todo[inline]{I don't see where \(\overline{f}(r) = \expval{f(r) | \Gamma } = \xi _i (r) \xi^{-1}_{ij} c_j\) comes from in general --- I can see it in the specific case \(C_i = f(r_i)\) through.} 

% They account for non-gaussianity through field (overdensity or gravitational potential) in the form \(\alpha \phi + \epsilon (\phi^2 - \expval{\phi^2 }) \), where \(\phi \) is Gaussian with zero mean. 
% They use the Press–Schechter formalism, considering the regions in which the linearized density perturbation  goes beyond \(\Delta  _c \approx 1.687\).
% Figure 4: the effect of adding the non-Gaussian tails is to boost by an order of magnitude the probability \(\mathbb{P}(> \delta _c | z_c, R)\), where \(z_c\) is the redshift we are considering while \(R\) is the filtering scale. 



% Equation 4.25 in \textcite[]{verdeMultivariateJointPDF2013} is a calculation tool: it allows us to calculate the average of an observable \(A\) for a non-Gaussian random field in a discretized space. 

% \textcite[]{planckcollaborationPlanck2018Results2019}: I guess I can interpret the PDF for the nongaussianity parameter, but not much else\dots

% \textcite[]{celoriaPrimordialNonGaussianity2018}: is EEE, TTT and such related to the three-point functions computed with different polarizations?
