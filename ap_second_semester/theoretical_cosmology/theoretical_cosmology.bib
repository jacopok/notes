  holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.
If a tensor changes sign under exchange of each pair of its indices, then the tensor is completely (or totally) antisymmetric.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor of order p may be referred to as a p-form, and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor may be referred to as a p-vector.},

  abstract = {The physical interpretation of perturbations of homogeneous, isotropic cosmological models in the early Universe, when the perturbation is larger than the particle horizon, is clarified by defining a complete set of gauge-invariant variables. The linearized perturbation equations written in these variables are simpler than the usual versions, and easily accommodate an arbitrary background equation of state, entropy perturbations, and anisotropic pressure perturbations. Particular attention is paid to how a scalar (density) perturbation might be generated by stress perturbations at very early times, when the non-gauge-invariant perturbation in the density itself is ill-defined. The amplitude of the fractional energy density perturbation at the particle horizon cannot be larger, in order of magnitude, than the maximum ratio of the stress perturbation to the background energy density at any earlier time, unless the perturbation is inherent in the initial singularity., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {We show, through an explicit calculation of the relevant Green's functions, that the transverse-traceless (TT) portion of the gravitational perturbations of Minkowski spacetime and of spatially flat cosmologies with a constant equation-of-state \$w\$ receive contributions from their isolated matter source(s) outside the past null cone of the observer. This implies the TT gravitational wave (GW) cannot be a standalone observable -- despite widespread (apparent) claims in the gravitational wave literature to the contrary. About a Minkowski background, all 4 of the gauge-invariant variables -- the two scalars, one vector and tensor -- play crucial roles to ensure the spatial tidal forces encoded within the gauge-invariant linearized Riemann tensor are causal. These gravitational tidal forces do not depend solely on the TT graviton but rather on the causal portion of its acceleration. However, in the far zone radiative limit, the flat spacetime `TT' graviton Green's function does reduce to the causal `tt' ones, which are the ones commonly used to compute gravitational waveforms. Similar remarks apply to the spin-1 photon; for instance, the electric field does not depend solely on the photon, but is the causal part of its velocity. As is known within the quantum theory of photons and linearized gravitons, there are obstacles to the construction of simultaneously gauge-invariant and Lorentz-covariant descriptions of these massless spin-1 and spin-2 states. Our results transparently demonstrate that the quantum operators associated with the helicity-1 photon and helicity-2 linear graviton both violate micro-causality: namely, they do not commute outside the light cone in flat and cosmological spacetimes.},

The recent discovery of the previously predicted acoustic peaks in the power spectrum has established a working cosmological model: a critical density universe consisting of mainly dark matter and dark energy, which formed its structure through gravitational instability from quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch. Future observations should test this model and measure its key cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. The phenomenology and cosmological implications of the acoustic peaks are developed in detail. Beyond the peaks, the yet to be detected secondary anisotropies and polarization present opportunities to study the physics of inflation and the dark energy. The analysis techniques devised to extract cosmological information from voluminous CMB data sets are outlined, given their increasing importance in experimental cosmology as a whole.},

Stressing model independent results, we show how the microwave background can be used to extract information on the mass density, vacuum density, baryon content, radiation content, expansion rate and some aspects of structure formation in the universe. To address these issues, we systematically develop relativistic kinetic and perturbation theory addressing issues such as fluctuation representation, or gauge, normal mode analysis in an open geometry, and second order effects. Through analytic and numerical results, we construct anisotropies in a critical, open, or cosmological constant universe with adiabatic and/or isocurvature initial conditions allowing for possible early reionization. We find that anisotropy formation is a simple process governed by the Compton scattering of photons and electrons and their gravitational coupling to the other particle species in the universe.},

We explore the use of analytic approximations for the gravitational-wave evolution, making use of the WKB approach to handle the radiation-matter transition. In the process, we describe scaling relations for the temperature and polarisation power spectra. We illustrate the dependence of the amplitude, shape, and peak locations on the details of recombination, the gravitational-wave power spectrum, and the cosmological parameters, and explain the origin of the peak locations in the temperature and polarisation power spectra. The decline in power on small scales in the polarisation power spectra is discussed in terms of phase-damping. In an appendix we detail numerical techniques for integrating the gravitational-wave evolution in the presence of anisotropic stress from free-streaming neutrinos.},

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},
