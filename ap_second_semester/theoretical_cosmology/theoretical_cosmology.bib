  abstract = {In mathematics and theoretical physics, a tensor is antisymmetric on (or with respect to) an index subset if it alternates sign (+/−) when any two indices of the subset are interchanged. The index subset must generally either be all covariant or all contravariant.
For example,

  
    
      
        
          T
          
            i
            j
            k
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            j
            i
            k
            …
          
        
        =
        
          T
          
            j
            k
            i
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            k
            j
            i
            …
          
        
        =
        
          T
          
            k
            i
            j
            …
          
        
        =
        −
        
          T
          
            i
            k
            j
            …
          
        
      
    
    \{\textbackslash{}displaystyle T\_\{ijk\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{jik\textbackslash{}dots \}=T\_\{jki\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{kji\textbackslash{}dots \}=T\_\{kij\textbackslash{}dots \}=-T\_\{ikj\textbackslash{}dots \}\}
  holds when the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to its first three indices.
If a tensor changes sign under exchange of each pair of its indices, then the tensor is completely (or totally) antisymmetric.  A completely antisymmetric covariant tensor of order p may be referred to as a p-form, and a completely antisymmetric contravariant tensor may be referred to as a p-vector.},

  abstract = {Modern Cosmology begins with an introduction to the smooth, homogeneous 
universe described by a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric, including
careful treatments of dark energy, big bang nucleosynthesis,
recombination, and dark matter. From this starting point, the reader is
introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with
the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial
inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences
include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum
with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy
surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and Modern Cosmology
is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic
peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow
for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis
techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers
will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern
observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity.

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},
