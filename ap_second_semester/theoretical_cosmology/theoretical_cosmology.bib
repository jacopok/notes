  abstract = {By correlating the signals from a pair of gravitational-wave detectors, one can undertake sensitive searches for a stochastic background of gravitational radiation. If the stochastic background is anisotropic, then this correlated signal varies harmonically with the earth's rotation. We calculate how the harmonics of this varying signal are related to the multipole moments which characterize the anisotropy, and give a formula for the signal-to-noise ratio of a given harmonic. The specific case of the two LIGO (Laser Interferometric Gravitational Observatory) detectors, which will begin operation around the year 2000, is analyzed in detail. We consider two possible examples of anisotropy. If the gravitational-wave stochastic background contains a dipole intensity anisotropy whose origin (like that of the Cosmic Background Radiation) is motion of our local system, then that anisotropy will be observable by the advanced LIGO detector (with 90\% confidence in one year of observation) if \textbackslash Omega\_\{gw\} {$>$} 5.3 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-8\} h\_\{100\}\^\{-2\}. We also study the signal produced by stochastic sources distributed in the same way as the luminous matter in the galactic disk, and in the same way as the galactic halo. The anisotropy due to sources distributed as the galactic disk or as the galactic halo will be observable by the advanced LIGO detector (with 90\% confidence in one year of observation) if \textbackslash Omega\_\{gw\} {$>$} 1.8 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-10\} h\_\{100\}\^\{-2\} or \textbackslash Omega\_\{gw\} {$>$} 6.7 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-8\} h\_\{100\}\^\{-2\}, respectively.},

  abstract = {The physical interpretation of perturbations of homogeneous, isotropic cosmological models in the early Universe, when the perturbation is larger than the particle horizon, is clarified by defining a complete set of gauge-invariant variables. The linearized perturbation equations written in these variables are simpler than the usual versions, and easily accommodate an arbitrary background equation of state, entropy perturbations, and anisotropic pressure perturbations. Particular attention is paid to how a scalar (density) perturbation might be generated by stress perturbations at very early times, when the non-gauge-invariant perturbation in the density itself is ill-defined. The amplitude of the fractional energy density perturbation at the particle horizon cannot be larger, in order of magnitude, than the maximum ratio of the stress perturbation to the background energy density at any earlier time, unless the perturbation is inherent in the initial singularity., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract = {We show, through an explicit calculation of the relevant Green's functions, that the transverse-traceless (TT) portion of the gravitational perturbations of Minkowski spacetime and of spatially flat cosmologies with a constant equation-of-state \$w\$ receive contributions from their isolated matter source(s) outside the past null cone of the observer. This implies the TT gravitational wave (GW) cannot be a standalone observable -- despite widespread (apparent) claims in the gravitational wave literature to the contrary. About a Minkowski background, all 4 of the gauge-invariant variables -- the two scalars, one vector and tensor -- play crucial roles to ensure the spatial tidal forces encoded within the gauge-invariant linearized Riemann tensor are causal. These gravitational tidal forces do not depend solely on the TT graviton but rather on the causal portion of its acceleration. However, in the far zone radiative limit, the flat spacetime `TT' graviton Green's function does reduce to the causal `tt' ones, which are the ones commonly used to compute gravitational waveforms. Similar remarks apply to the spin-1 photon; for instance, the electric field does not depend solely on the photon, but is the causal part of its velocity. As is known within the quantum theory of photons and linearized gravitons, there are obstacles to the construction of simultaneously gauge-invariant and Lorentz-covariant descriptions of these massless spin-1 and spin-2 states. Our results transparently demonstrate that the quantum operators associated with the helicity-1 photon and helicity-2 linear graviton both violate micro-causality: namely, they do not commute outside the light cone in flat and cosmological spacetimes.},

The recent discovery of the previously predicted acoustic peaks in the power spectrum has established a working cosmological model: a critical density universe consisting of mainly dark matter and dark energy, which formed its structure through gravitational instability from quantum fluctuations during an inflationary epoch. Future observations should test this model and measure its key cosmological parameters with unprecedented precision. The phenomenology and cosmological implications of the acoustic peaks are developed in detail. Beyond the peaks, the yet to be detected secondary anisotropies and polarization present opportunities to study the physics of inflation and the dark energy. The analysis techniques devised to extract cosmological information from voluminous CMB data sets are outlined, given their increasing importance in experimental cosmology as a whole.},

Distortions in the frequency or spectral distribution of the background probe the thermal history of the universe whereas those in the angular temperature distribution probe its dynamics and geometry. Stressing model independent results, we show how the microwave background can be used to extract information on the mass density, vacuum density, baryon content, radiation content, expansion rate and some aspects of structure formation in the universe. To address these issues, we systematically develop relativistic kinetic and perturbation theory addressing issues such as fluctuation representation, or gauge, normal mode analysis in an open geometry, and second order effects. Through analytic and numerical results, we construct anisotropies in a critical, open, or cosmological constant universe with adiabatic and/or isocurvature initial conditions allowing for possible early reionization. We find that anisotropy formation is a simple process governed by the Compton scattering of photons and electrons and their gravitational coupling to the other particle species in the universe.},

In this paper, we focus on scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories, invariant under linear coordinate transformations. In the case of scalar-tensor theories, we use our framework to recover the simple parametrizations of linearized Horndeski and "Beyond Horndeski" theories, and also find higher-derivative corrections. In the case of vector-tensor theories, we first construct the most general quadratic action for perturbations that leads to second-order equations of motion, which propagates two scalar DoFs. Then we specialize to the case in which the vector field is time-like (\textbackslash `a la Einstein-Aether gravity), where the theory only propagates one scalar DoF. As a result, we identify the complete forms of the quadratic actions for perturbations, and the number of free parameters that need to be defined, to cosmologically characterize these two broad classes of theories.},

uniform initial state to a progressively more irregular and clumpy
universe. The discussion centers on the clusters of galaxies, the
empirical evidence of the nature of clustering, and theories of how the
clustering evolves in an expanding universe. A historical introduction
to the subject is given; and a survey of methods used to deal with the
Newtonian approximation to the theory of the evolution of the mass
distribution is presented. Recent progress in the use of statistical
measures of the clustering is described; and techniques for dealing with
cosmic evolution, in the statistical measures of clustering and under
general relativity theory, are considered. An assessment is made of
attempts to link theory and observation to arrive at a well-established
physical picture of the nature and evolution of the universe.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {We develop an analytic approach to calculation of the temperature and polarisation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background due to inflationary gravitational waves. This approach complements the more precise numerical results by providing insight into the physical origins of the features in the power spectra. We explore the use of analytic approximations for the gravitational-wave evolution, making use of the WKB approach to handle the radiation-matter transition. In the process, we describe scaling relations for the temperature and polarisation power spectra. We illustrate the dependence of the amplitude, shape, and peak locations on the details of recombination, the gravitational-wave power spectrum, and the cosmological parameters, and explain the origin of the peak locations in the temperature and polarisation power spectra. The decline in power on small scales in the polarisation power spectra is discussed in terms of phase-damping. In an appendix we detail numerical techniques for integrating the gravitational-wave evolution in the presence of anisotropic stress from free-streaming neutrinos.},

  abstract = {The conventional cold, particle interpretation of dark matter (CDM) still lacks laboratory support and struggles with the basic properties of common dwarf galaxies, which have surprisingly uniform central masses and shallow density profiles. In contrast, galaxies predicted by CDM extend to much lower masses, with steeper, singular profiles. This tension motivates cold, wavelike dark matter (\$\textbackslash psi\$DM) composed of a non-relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate, so the uncertainty principle counters gravity below a Jeans scale. Here we achieve the first cosmological simulations of this quantum state at unprecedentedly high resolution capable of resolving dwarf galaxies, with only one free parameter, \$\textbackslash bf\{m\_B\}\$, the boson mass. We demonstrate the large scale structure of this \$\textbackslash psi\$DM simulation is indistinguishable from CDM, as desired, but differs radically inside galaxies. Connected filaments and collapsed haloes form a large interference network, with gravitationally self-bound solitonic cores inside every galaxy surrounded by extended haloes of fluctuating density granules. These results allow us to determine \$\textbackslash bf\{m\_B=(8.1\^\{+1.6\}\_\{-1.7\})\textbackslash times 10\^\{-23\}\textasciitilde eV\}\$ using stellar phase-space distributions in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Denser, more massive solitons are predicted for Milky Way sized galaxies, providing a substantial seed to help explain early spheroid formation. Suppression of small structures means the onset of galaxy formation for \$\textbackslash psi\$DM is substantially delayed relative to CDM, appearing at \$\textbackslash bf\{z\textbackslash lesssim 13\}\$ in our simulations.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity.

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},
