  abstract = {In the framework of the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field, we impose as primary condition on the dynamics the positive definiteness of the energy spectrum. This implies that (Glauber) coherent states have to be considered for the longitudinal and the scalar photon fields. As a result we obtain that the relation holds which in the traditional approach is called the Gupta-Bleuler condition. Gauge invariance emerges as a property of the physical states. The group structure of the theory is recognized to be the one of \$SU(2) \textbackslash otimes SU(1,1)\$.},

The phenomenology of W and Z bosons is discussed and implications for the Higgs boson are derived from comparison with experimental precision data.},

  abstract = {The author advocates two specific mathematical notations from his popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete Mathematics". The first of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.},
