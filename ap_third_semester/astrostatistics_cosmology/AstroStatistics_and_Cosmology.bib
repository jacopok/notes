  abstract = {The Fisher matrix approach (Fisher 1935) allows one to calculate in advance how well a given experiment will be able to estimate model parameters, and has been an invaluable tool in experimental design. In the same spirit, we present here a method to predict how well a given experiment can distinguish between different models, regardless of their parameters. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence. In this paper, we generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to that of model testing, and show how the expected evidence can be computed under the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix approach for parameter estimation. With this `Laplace approximation' all that is needed to compute the expected evidence is the Fisher matrix itself. We illustrate the method with a study of how well upcoming and planned experiments should perform at distinguishing between Dark Energy models and modified gravity theories. In particular we consider the combination of 3D weak lensing, for which planned and proposed wide-field multi-band imaging surveys will provide suitable data, and probes of the expansion history of the Universe, such as proposed supernova and baryonic acoustic oscillations surveys. We find that proposed large-scale weak lensing surveys from space should be able readily to distinguish General Relativity from modified gravity models.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for performing joint analyses of cosmological datasets, in which the weight assigned to each dataset is determined directly by it own statistical properties. The weights are considered in a Bayesian context as a set of hyperparameters, which are then marginalised over in order to recover the posterior distribution as a function only of the cosmological parameters of interest. In the case of a Gaussian likelihood function, this marginalisation may be performed analytically. Calculation of the Bayesian evidence for the data, with and without the introduction of hyperparameters, enables a direct determination of whether the data warrant the introduction of weights into the analysis; this generalises the standard likelihood ratio approach to model comparison. The method is illustrated by application to the classic toy problem of fitting a straight line to a set of data. A cosmological illustration of the technique is also presented, in which the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum are used to infer constraints on cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: • From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. • Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. • Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. • Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. • Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. • In “nonstandard” statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. • The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. • When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. • Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. • Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. • It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

We demonstrate with simulated data sets that our method delivers tighter statistical constraints on the cosmological parameters over 90\% of the time, that it reduces statistical bias typically by a factor \textasciitilde{} 2-3 and that it has better coverage properties than the usual chi-squared approach. As a further benefit, a full posterior probability distribution for the dispersion of the intrinsic magnitude of SNe is obtained. We apply this method to recent SNIa data, and by combining them with CMB and BAO data we obtain Omega\_m=0.28 +/- 0.02, Omega\_Lambda=0.73 +/- 0.01 (assuming w=-1) and Omega\_m=0.28 +/- 0.01, w=-0.90 +/- 0.05 (assuming flatness; statistical uncertainties only). We constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the B-band magnitude of the SNIa population, obtaining sigma\_mu\^int = 0.13 +/- 0.01 [mag]. Applications to systematic uncertainties will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

After explaining the basic principles of Bayesian probability theory, their use is illustrated with a variety of examples ranging from elementary parameter estimation to image processing. Other topics covered include reliability analysis, multivariate optimization, least-squares and maximum likelihood, error-propagation, hypothesis testing, maximum entropy and experimental design.  The Second Edition of this successful tutorial book contains a new chapter on extensions to the ubiquitous least-squares procedure, allowing for the straightforward handling of outliers and unknown correlated noise, and a cutting-edge contribution from John Skilling on a novel numerical technique for Bayesian computation called 'nested sampling'.},

  abstract = {WMAP precision data enables accurate testing of cosmological models. We find that the emerging standard model of cosmology, a flat Lambda-dominated universe seeded by nearly scale-invariant adiabatic Gaussian fluctuations, fits the WMAP data. With parameters fixed only by WMAP data, we can fit finer scale CMB measurements and measurements of large scle structure (galaxy surveys and the Lyman alpha forest). This simple model is also consistent with a host of other astronomical measurements. We then fit the model parameters to a combination of WMAP data with other finer scale CMB experiments (ACBAR and CBI), 2dFGRS measurements and Lyman alpha forest data to find the model's best fit cosmological parameters: h=0.71+0.04-0.03, Omega\_b h\^2=0.0224+-0.0009, Omega\_m h\^2=0.135+0.008-0.009, tau=0.17+-0.06, n\_s(0.05/Mpc)=0.93+-0.03, and sigma\_8=0.84+-0.04. WMAP's best determination of tau=0.17+-0.04 arises directly from the TE data and not from this model fit, but they are consistent. These parameters imply that the age of the universe is 13.7+-0.2 Gyr. The data favors but does not require a slowly varying spectral index. By combining WMAP data with other astronomical data sets, we constrain the geometry of the universe, Omega\_tot = 1.02 +- 0.02, the equation of state of the dark energy w {$<$} -0.78 (95\% confidence limit assuming w {$>$}= -1), and the energy density in stable neutrinos, Omega\_nu h\^2 {$<$} 0.0076 (95\% confidence limit). For 3 degenerate neutrino species, this limit implies that their mass is less than 0.23 eV (95\% confidence limit). The WMAP detection of early reionization rules out warm dark matter.},

  abstract = {We describe our methodology for comparing the WMAP measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other complementary data sets to theoretical models. The unprecedented quality of the WMAP data, and the tight constraints on cosmological parameters that are derived, require a rigorous analysis so that the approximations made in the modeling do not lead to significant biases. We describe our use of the likelihood function to characterize the statistical properties of the microwave background sky. We outline the use of the Monte Carlo Markov Chains to explore the likelihood of the data given a model to determine the best fit cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. We add to the WMAP data the l{$>\sptilde$}700 CBI and ACBAR measurements of the CMB, the galaxy power spectrum at z\textasciitilde 0 obtained from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS), and the matter power spectrum at z\textasciitilde 3 as measured with the Ly alpha forest. These last two data sets complement the CMB measurements by probing the matter power spectrum of the nearby universe. Combining CMB and 2dFGRS requires that we include in our analysis a model for galaxy bias, redshift distortions, and the non-linear growth of structure. We show how the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the model and the data are propagated through the full analysis.},
