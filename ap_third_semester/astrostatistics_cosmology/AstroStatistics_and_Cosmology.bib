  abstract = {We describe and implement an exact, flexible, and computationally efficient algorithm for joint component separation and CMB power spectrum estimation, building on a Gibbs sampling framework. Two essential new features are (1) conditional sampling of foreground spectral parameters and (2) joint sampling of all amplitude-type degrees of freedom (e.g., CMB, foreground pixel amplitudes, and global template amplitudes) given spectral parameters. Given a parametric model of the foreground signals, we estimate efficiently and accurately the exact joint foregroundCMB posterior distribution and, therefore, all marginal distributions such as the CMB power spectrum or foreground spectral index posteriors. The main limitation of the current implementation is the requirement of identical beam responses at all frequencies, which restricts the analysis to the lowest resolution of a given experiment. We outline a future generalization to multiresolution observations. To verify the method, we analyze simple models and compare the results to analytical predictions. We then analyze a realistic simulation with properties similar to the 3 yr WMAP data, downgraded to a common resolution of 3  FWHM. The results from the actual 3 yr WMAP temperature analysis are presented in a companion Letter.},

In order to facilitate this analysis, a number of sophistications have to be introduced, each of which is discussed in detail. We have implemented two independent versions of the algorithm to cross-check the computer codes, and to verify that a particular solution to any given problem does not affect the scientific results. We then apply these programs to simulated data with known properties at intermediate (N\_side = 128) and high (N\_side = 512) resolutions, to study effects such as incomplete sky coverage and white vs. correlated noise. From these simulations we also establish the Markov chain correlation length as a function of signal-to-noise ratio, and give a few comments on the properties of the correlation matrices involved. Parallelization issues are also discussed, with emphasis on real-world limitations imposed by current super-computer facilities. The scientific results from the analysis of the first-year WMAP data are presented in a companion letter.},

  abstract = {The Fisher matrix approach (Fisher 1935) allows one to calculate in advance how well a given experiment will be able to estimate model parameters, and has been an invaluable tool in experimental design. In the same spirit, we present here a method to predict how well a given experiment can distinguish between different models, regardless of their parameters. From a Bayesian viewpoint, this involves computation of the Bayesian evidence. In this paper, we generalise the Fisher matrix approach from the context of parameter fitting to that of model testing, and show how the expected evidence can be computed under the same simplifying assumption of a gaussian likelihood as the Fisher matrix approach for parameter estimation. With this `Laplace approximation' all that is needed to compute the expected evidence is the Fisher matrix itself. We illustrate the method with a study of how well upcoming and planned experiments should perform at distinguishing between Dark Energy models and modified gravity theories. In particular we consider the combination of 3D weak lensing, for which planned and proposed wide-field multi-band imaging surveys will provide suitable data, and probes of the expansion history of the Universe, such as proposed supernova and baryonic acoustic oscillations surveys. We find that proposed large-scale weak lensing surveys from space should be able readily to distinguish General Relativity from modified gravity models.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for performing joint analyses of cosmological datasets, in which the weight assigned to each dataset is determined directly by it own statistical properties. The weights are considered in a Bayesian context as a set of hyperparameters, which are then marginalised over in order to recover the posterior distribution as a function only of the cosmological parameters of interest. In the case of a Gaussian likelihood function, this marginalisation may be performed analytically. Calculation of the Bayesian evidence for the data, with and without the introduction of hyperparameters, enables a direct determination of whether the data warrant the introduction of weights into the analysis; this generalises the standard likelihood ratio approach to model comparison. The method is illustrated by application to the classic toy problem of fitting a straight line to a set of data. A cosmological illustration of the technique is also presented, in which the latest measurements of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum are used to infer constraints on cosmological parameters.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: • From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. • Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. • Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. • Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. • Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. • In “nonstandard” statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. • The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. • When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. • Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. • Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. • It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

We demonstrate with simulated data sets that our method delivers tighter statistical constraints on the cosmological parameters over 90\% of the time, that it reduces statistical bias typically by a factor \textasciitilde{} 2-3 and that it has better coverage properties than the usual chi-squared approach. As a further benefit, a full posterior probability distribution for the dispersion of the intrinsic magnitude of SNe is obtained. We apply this method to recent SNIa data, and by combining them with CMB and BAO data we obtain Omega\_m=0.28 +/- 0.02, Omega\_Lambda=0.73 +/- 0.01 (assuming w=-1) and Omega\_m=0.28 +/- 0.01, w=-0.90 +/- 0.05 (assuming flatness; statistical uncertainties only). We constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the B-band magnitude of the SNIa population, obtaining sigma\_mu\^int = 0.13 +/- 0.01 [mag].

We add to the WMAP data the l{$>\sptilde$}700 CBI and ACBAR measurements of the CMB, the galaxy power spectrum at z\textasciitilde 0 obtained from the 2dF galaxy redshift survey (2dFGRS), and the matter power spectrum at z\textasciitilde 3 as measured with the Ly alpha forest. These last two data sets complement the CMB measurements by probing the matter power spectrum of the nearby universe.

  abstract = {We describe an efficient and exact method that enables global Bayesian analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The method reveals the joint posterior density (or likelihood for flat priors) of the power spectrum \$C\_\textbackslash ell\$ and the CMB signal. Foregrounds and instrumental parameters can be simultaneously inferred from the data. The method allows the specification of a wide range of foreground priors. We explicitly show how to propagate the non-Gaussian dependency structure of the \$C\_\textbackslash ell\$ posterior through to the posterior density of the parameters. If desired, the analysis can be coupled to theoretical (cosmological) priors and can yield the posterior density of cosmological parameter estimates directly from the time-ordered data. The method does not hinge on special assumptions about the survey geometry or noise properties, etc. It is based on a Monte Carlo approach and hence parallelizes trivially. No trace or determinant evaluations are necessary. The feasibility of this approach rests on the ability to solve the systems of linear equations which arise. These are of the same size and computational complexity as the map-making equations. We describe a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient technique that solves this problem and demonstrate in a numerical example that the computational time required for each Monte Carlo sample scales as \$n\_p\^\{3/2\}\$ with the number of pixels \$n\_p\$. We test our method using the COBE-DMR data and explore the non-Gaussian joint posterior density of the COBE-DMR \$C\_\textbackslash ell\$ in several projections.},
