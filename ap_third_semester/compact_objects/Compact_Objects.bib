  abstract = {We compare three different models of rotating neutron star spacetimes: the Hartle-Thorne (HT) slow-rotation approximation at second order in rotation, the exact analytic vacuum solution of Manko et al. and a numerical solution of the full Einstein equations. We integrate the HT structure equations for five representative equations of state. Then we match the HT models to numerical solutions of the Einstein equations, imposing that the mass and angular momentum of the models be the same. We estimate the limits of validity of the HT expansion computing relative errors in the spacetime's quadrupole moment Q and in the ISCO radii. We find that ISCO radii computed in the HT approximation are accurate to better than 1\%, even for the fastest observed ms pulsar. At the same rotational rates the accuracy on Q is of order 20\%. In the second part of the paper we focus on the exterior vacuum spacetimes. We introduce a physically motivated `quasi-Kinnersley' Newman-Penrose frame. In this frame we evaluate the speciality index S, a coordinate-independent quantity measuring the deviation of each model from Petrov Type D. On the equatorial plane this deviation is smaller than 5\%, even for the fastest rotating models. Our main conclusion is that the HT approximation is very reliable for most astrophysical applications.},

  abstract = {Understanding the predictions of general relativity for the dynamical interactions of two black holes has been a long-standing unsolved problem in theoretical physics. Black-hole mergers are monumental astrophysical events, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational radiation, and are key sources for both ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The black-hole merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational waveforms can only be calculated through numerical simulations of Einstein's equations of general relativity. For many years, numerical relativists attempting to model these mergers encountered a host of problems, causing their codes to crash after just a fraction of a binary orbit could be simulated. Recently, however, a series of dramatic advances in numerical relativity has allowed stable, robust black-hole merger simulations. This remarkable progress in the rapidly maturing field of numerical relativity, and the new understanding of black-hole binary dynamics that is emerging is chronicled. Important applications of these fundamental physics results to astrophysics, to gravitational-wave astronomy, and in other areas are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherical accretion onto a Schwarzschild hole  is here reinvestigated by the construction of a self-consistent model which incorporates all relevant physical processes taking place in an astrophysical plasma, apart from the presence of magnetic fields and dissipative processes. In particular, transfer of radiation through the accreting gas is treated in full generality using a completely relativistic formalism. A careful analysis of critical points and boundary conditions for radiation hydrodynamics equations is performed. The complete topology of solutions in the accretion rate-luminosity plane is obtained, showing the existence of two distinct branches of models with very different emission properties: stationary accretion reveals, therefore, a bimodal behavior. By means of a self-consistent study of the effects of Compton heating, both the upper and the lower bounds for the existence of high-luminosity solutions were derived. The stability of the two possible accretion regimes is also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity. The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult. Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation. For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux. The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another. In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},
