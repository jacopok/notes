In particular, we propose a simple and elegant combination of the Weyl invariants I and J, the \{\textbackslash sl speciality index\} \$\{\textbackslash cal S\}\$. In the context of black hole perturbations \$\textbackslash cal S\$ provides a measure of the size of the distortions from an ideal Kerr black hole spacetime. Explicit calculations in well-known examples of axisymmetric black hole collisions demonstrate that this quantity may serve as a useful tool for predicting in which cases perturbative dynamics provide an accurate estimate of the radiation waveform and energy. This makes \$\{\textbackslash cal S\}\$ particularly suited to studying the transition from nonlinear to linear dynamics and for invariant interpretation of numerical results.},

  abstract = {An external reference system suitable for deep space navigation can be defined by fast spinning and strongly magnetized neutron stars, called pulsars. Their beamed periodic signals have timing stabilities comparable to atomic clocks and provide characteristic temporal signatures that can be used as natural navigation beacons, quite similar to the use of GPS satellites for navigation on Earth. By comparing pulse arrival times measured on-board a spacecraft with predicted pulse arrivals at a reference location, the spacecraft position can be determined autonomously and with high accuracy everywhere in the solar system and beyond. The unique properties of pulsars make clear already today that such a navigation system will have its application in future astronautics. In this paper we describe the basic principle of spacecraft navigation using pulsars and report on the current development status of this novel technology.},

  abstract = {A photon emitted near a compact object at an angle \$\textbackslash alpha\$ with respect to the radial direction escapes to infinity at a different angle \$\textbackslash psi{$>\backslash$}alpha\$. This bending of light is caused by a strong gravitational field. We show that, in a Schwarzschild metric, the effect is described by \$1-\textbackslash cos\textbackslash alpha=(1-\textbackslash cos\textbackslash psi)(1-r\_g/R)\$ where \$R/r\_g\$ is the emission radius in Schwarzschild units. The formula is approximate and it applies at \$R\textbackslash geq 2r\_g\$ only, however at these radii it has amazing accuracy, fully sufficient in many applications. As one application we develop a new formulation for the light bending effects in pulsars. It reveals the simple character of these effects and gives their quantitative description with practically no losses of accuracy (for the typical radius of a neutron star \$R=3r\_g\$ the error is 1\%). The visible fraction of a star surface is shown to be \$S\_v/4\textbackslash pi R\^2=[2(1-r\_g/R)]\^\{-1\}\$ which is 3/4 for \$R=3r\_g\$. The instantaneous flux of a pulsar comes from one or two antipodal polar caps that rotate in the visible zone. The pulse produced by one blackbody cap is found to be sinusoidal (light bending impacts the pulse amplitude but not its shape). When both caps are visible, the pulse shows a plateau: the variable parts of the antipodal emissions precisely cancel each other. The pulsed fraction of blackbody emission with antipodal symmetry has an upper limit \$A\_\{max\}=(R-2r\_g)/(R+2r\_g)\$. Pulsars with \$A{$>$}A\_\{max\}\$ must be asymmetric.},

We integrate the HT structure equations for five representative equations of state. Then we match the HT models to numerical solutions of the Einstein equations, imposing that the mass and angular momentum of the models be the same. We estimate the limits of validity of the HT expansion computing relative errors in the spacetime's quadrupole moment Q and in the ISCO radii. We find that ISCO radii computed in the HT approximation are accurate to better than 1\%, even for the fastest observed ms pulsar. At the same rotational rates the accuracy on Q is of order 20\%. In the second part of the paper we focus on the exterior vacuum spacetimes. We introduce a physically motivated `quasi-Kinnersley' Newman-Penrose frame. In this frame we evaluate the speciality index S, a coordinate-independent quantity measuring the deviation of each model from Petrov Type D. On the equatorial plane this deviation is smaller than 5\%, even for the fastest rotating models. Our main conclusion is that the HT approximation is very reliable for most astrophysical applications.},

  abstract = {Understanding the predictions of general relativity for the dynamical interactions of two black holes has been a long-standing unsolved problem in theoretical physics. Black-hole mergers are monumental astrophysical events, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of gravitational radiation, and are key sources for both ground- and space-based gravitational-wave detectors. The black-hole merger dynamics and the resulting gravitational waveforms can only be calculated through numerical simulations of Einstein's equations of general relativity. For many years, numerical relativists attempting to model these mergers encountered a host of problems, causing their codes to crash after just a fraction of a binary orbit could be simulated. Recently, however, a series of dramatic advances in numerical relativity has allowed stable, robust black-hole merger simulations. This remarkable progress in the rapidly maturing field of numerical relativity, and the new understanding of black-hole binary dynamics that is emerging is chronicled. Important applications of these fundamental physics results to astrophysics, to gravitational-wave astronomy, and in other areas are also discussed.},

The Kerr solution is only unique if the multipole moments of its mass and its angular momentum take on prescribed values. Its metric can be interpreted as the exterior gravitational field of a suitably rotating mass distribution. Both solutions describe objects exhibiting an event horizon, a frontier of no return.

In particular, alpha-dot strongly impacts on the braking torque, an effect which has been largely ignored in previous work. We carry out simulations which include a negative alpha-dot term, and show that it is possible to reproduce the observational P-Pdot diagram without the need for either pulsars with long birth periods or magnetic field decay. Our best model indicates a birth rate of 1 radio pulsar per century and a total Galactic population of \textasciitilde 20000 pulsars beaming towards Earth.},

A careful analysis of critical points and boundary conditions for radiation hydrodynamics equations is performed. The complete topology of solutions in the accretion rate-luminosity plane is obtained, showing the existence of two distinct branches of models with very different emission properties: stationary accretion reveals, therefore, a bimodal behavior. By means of a self-consistent study of the effects of Compton heating, both the upper and the lower bounds for the existence of high-luminosity solutions were derived. The stability of the two possible accretion regimes is also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {A special class of orbits known to exist around a Kerr black hole are spherical orbits -- orbits with constant coordinate radii that are not necessarily confined to the equatorial plane. Spherical time-like orbits were first studied by Wilkins almost 50 years ago. In the present paper, we perform a systematic and thorough study of these orbits, encompassing and extending previous works on them. We first present simplified forms for the parameters of these orbits. The parameter space of these orbits is then analysed in detail; in particular, we delineate the boundaries between stable and unstable orbits, bound and unbound orbits, and prograde and retrograde orbits. Finally, we provide analytic solutions of the geodesic equations, and illustrate a few representative examples of these orbits.},

  abstract = {The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity. The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult. Here I explore the adiabatic case first; then I consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat transfer happens through electromagnetic radiation. For the latter I apply the PSTF formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux. The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another. In order to treat this problem, first I briefly recall the formalism of general relativity; then I treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.},

  abstract = {Since the full General Theory of Relativity has been unveiled to the scientific community in 1915, many solutions to the vacuum Einstein field equations have been found and studied. This paper aims at documenting exhaustively the derivation of the shape of the patch of the sky that is left completely black by a spinning black hole described by the Kerr solutions in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. This dark zone in the observer's sky is called the black hole shadow. Conserved quantities which allow for the analysis of particle orbits are first introduced, with the help of which the trajectories of photons are uniquely described by two impact parameters (Specific angular momentum in the azimuthal direction L and dimensionless Carter's constant Q). We then derive the conditions on those parameters required for a photon to be captured by the black hole. These conditions are then translated into an equation for the black hole shadow. We conclude the paper by drawing out the black hole shadows for an equatorial observer for two separate cases.},

  abstract = {Pulsar death line can be defined in \$P-\textbackslash dot\{P\}\$ diagram. Traditionally, radio-loud pulsars are supposed to locate above the death line where is the radio-loud region. With the development of observational equipment, the observational properties of the neutron star are remarkably diverse. In \$P-\textbackslash dot\{P\}\$ diagram, some of the special sources are radio-quiet but lie above the death line. From the definition of the pulsar death line, different equation of states for neutron star or strange star results in different death lines. We discuss the influence of the equation of state on the pulsar death line and the possible link between different neutron star groups. The results show that central compact objects would be the small mass of self-bound strange stars, and rotating radio transients might be old pulsars on the verge of death. We suggest that PSR J2144-3933 is likely to be a large mass pulsar, which would be larger than \$2.0\textbackslash rm\{M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\}\$. Multiple observational facts would help us to reveal the nature of pulsars.},
