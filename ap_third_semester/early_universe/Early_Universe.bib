  abstract = {The production of a stochastic background of gravitational waves is a fundamental prediction of any cosmological inflationary model. The features of such a signal encode unique information about the physics of the Early Universe and beyond, thus representing an exciting, powerful window on the origin and evolution of the Universe. We review the main mechanisms of gravitational-wave production, ranging from quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field to other mechanisms that can take place during or after inflation. These include e.g. gravitational waves generated as a consequence of extra particle production during inflation, or during the (p)reheating phase. Gravitational waves produced in inflation scenarios based on modified gravity theories and second-order gravitational waves are also considered. For each analyzed case, the expected power spectrum is given. We discuss the discriminating power among different models, associated with the validity/violation of the standard consistency relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio r and tensor spectral index nT. In light of the prospects for (directly/indirectly) detecting primordial gravitational waves, we give the expected present-day gravitational radiation spectral energy-density, highlighting the main characteristics imprinted by the cosmic thermal history, and we outline the signatures left by gravitational waves on the Cosmic Microwave Background and some imprints in the Large-Scale Structure of the Universe. Finally, current bounds and prospects of detection for inflationary gravitational waves are summarized.},

  abstract = {The recent data from the Boomerang and MAXIMA-1 balloon flights have marked the beginning of the precision era of Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy (CMB) measurements. We investigate the observational constraints from the current CMB anisotropy measurements on the simplest inflation models, characterized by a single scalar field \$\textbackslash phi\$, in the parameter space consisting of scalar spectral index \$n\_S\$ and tensor/scalar ratio \$r\$. If we include constraints on the baryon density from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), we show that the favored inflationary models have negligible tensor amplitude and a ``red'' tilt, with a best fit of \$n\_S \textbackslash simeq 0.93\$, which is consistent with the simplest ``small-field'' inflation models, but rules out large-field models at the \$1\textbackslash sigma\$ level. Without including BBN constraints, a broader range of models are consistent with the data. The best fit (assuming negligible reionization) is a scale-invariant spectrum, \$n\_S \textbackslash simeq 1\$, which includes large-field and hybrid scenarios. Large-field models (such as chaotic and power-law inflation) with tilt \$n\_S {$<$} 0.9\$ are strongly disfavored in all cases.},

Enormous progress has been made in this area in the last few years and this book is the first to provide a modern and unified overview. It covers all aspects of inflationary cosmology and carefully compares predictions with the latest observations, including those of the cosmic microwave background, the clustering and velocities of galaxies and the epoch of structure formation. Problems are included throughout to help the student to develop a thorough understanding. With the host of international experiments currently being performed and planned for the near future (including NASA's MAP satellite, and the European Space Agency's Planck mission), inflationary cosmology promises to be one of the most exciting and fruitful topics of research in science in the next decade. This book provides graduate students with the ideal introduction.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {We report on the implications for cosmic inflation of the 2018 Release of the Planck CMB anisotropy measurements. The results are fully consistent with the two previous Planck cosmological releases, but have smaller uncertainties thanks to improvements in the characterization of polarization at low and high multipoles. Planck temperature, polarization, and lensing data determine the spectral index of scalar perturbations to be \$n\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}=0.9649\textbackslash pm 0.0042\$ at 68\% CL and show no evidence for a scale dependence of \$n\_\textbackslash mathrm\{s\}.\$ Spatial flatness is confirmed at a precision of 0.4\% at 95\% CL with the combination with BAO data. The Planck 95\% CL upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, \$r\_\{0.002\}{$<$}0.10\$, is further tightened by combining with the BICEP2/Keck Array BK15 data to obtain \$r\_\{0.002\}{$<$}0.056\$. In the framework of single-field inflationary models with Einstein gravity, these results imply that: (a) slow-roll models with a concave potential, \$V" (\textbackslash phi) {$<$} 0,\$ are increasingly favoured by the data; and (b) two different methods for reconstructing the inflaton potential find no evidence for dynamics beyond slow roll. Non-parametric reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum consistently confirm a pure power law. A complementary analysis also finds no evidence for theoretically motivated parameterized features in the Planck power spectrum, a result further strengthened for certain oscillatory models by a new combined analysis that includes Planck bispectrum data. The new Planck polarization data provide a stringent test of the adiabaticity of the initial conditions. The polarization data also provide improved constraints on inflationary models that predict a small statistically anisotropic quadrupolar modulation of the primordial fluctuations. However, the polarization data do not confirm physical models for a scale-dependent dipolar modulation.},
