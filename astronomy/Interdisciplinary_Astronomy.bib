  abstract = {Nel 1982, Michel Foucault dedica il suo corso al Collège de France alla \&quot;cura di sé\&quot;. Questa nozione, più del famoso \&quot;conosci te stesso\&quot;, è nella cultura greca e latina il perno intorno a cui vengono organizzate le pratiche della filosofia, ossia quell’insieme di tecniche, esercizi e addestramenti che erano ritenuti necessari alla formazione dell’uomo maturo. In senso stretto per Foucault si tratta di passare in rassegna le grandi scuole filosofiche dell’antichità, mettendo in luce l’importanza che il pensiero greco prima, e latino poi, assegnavano al principio di \&quot;avere cura di se stessi\&quot;, di occuparsi attivamente della propria crescita spirituale e di \&quot;allenarsi\&quot; ad affrontare gli eventi futuri senza lasciarsi intimorire e senza lasciarsi trascinare dalle emozioni che tali eventi avrebbero potuto suscitare. Dunque si trattava di un vero e proprio addestramento volto al raggiungimento della piena padronanza di sé, all’autoformazione dell’uomo libero. Ma l’intento di Foucault non è circoscritto alla ricostruzione storico filosofica di questa pedagogia dell’anima. Ciò che gli preme mettere in luce è la precarietà dei modi attraverso cui avviene, all’opposto, la formazione dell’uomo moderno. Rileggere Platone, Seneca, Epitteto, Marco Aurelio, permette a Foucault di interrogarsi sui rapporti fra relazioni di potere, stati di dominio e assoggettamento delle coscienze nell’età moderna.},

We still look to the~stars today~for answers to fundamental questions: How did the universe begin? Will it end, and if so, how? What is our place within it? John North has been examining such questions for decades. In Cosmos, he offers a sweeping historical survey of the two sciences that help define our place in the universe: astronomy and cosmology. ~~~~~~~~~~~ Organizing his history chronologically, North begins by examining Paleolithic cave drawings that clearly chart the phases of the moon. He then investigates scientific practices in the early civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, and the Americas (among others), whose inhabitants developed sophisticated methods to record the movements of the planets and stars. Trade routes and religious movements, North notes, brought these ancient styles of scientific thinking to the attention of later astronomers, whose own theories—such as Copernicus’ planetary theory—led to the Scientific Revolution. ~~~~~~~~~~~ The work of master astronomers, including Ptolemy, Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, is described in detail, as are modern-day developments in astrophysics, such as the advent of radio astronomy, the brilliant innovations of Einstein, and the many recent discoveries brought about with the help of the Hubble telescope. This new edition brings North’s seminal book right up to the present day, as North takes a closer look at last year’s reclassification of Pluto as a “dwarf” planet and gives a thorough overview of current research.~~~~~~~~~~~ With more than two hundred illustrations and a comprehensive bibliography, Cosmos is the definitive history of astronomy and cosmology. It is sure to find an eager audience among historians of science and astronomers alike.},

  abstract = {The classical map of the sky, with the 48 Greek constellations, was derived from at least two different pre-Greek traditions. One tradition comprised the 12 signs of the zodiac, with several associated animal constellations, all of which developed over \textasciitilde 3200-500 BC in Mesopotamia in a religious or ritual tradition. These were taken over by the Greeks around 500 BC. However the other Babylonian constellations, their farming-calendar tradition, were not adopted. The other tradition was not Mesopotamian; it comprised large constellations which appear to date from \textasciitilde 2800 BC, probably from the Mediterranean region, devised for the navigators of ships. They include huge bears and serpents which marked the celestial pole and equator at that time, and probably the four anonymous giants which we know as Hercules, Ophiuchus, Bootes, and Auriga, as well as some of the large southern 'marine' constellations. The origins of some other constellations, including the Perseus tableau and various animals, are unknown; they may have been new creations of the Greeks. The Greeks assembled the classical sky-map from these different sources between 540-370 BC, but many of the familiar legends were only applied to the constellations later.},

  abstract = {1. BACKGROUND The Farnese Atlas is a Roman statue depicting the Titan Atlas holding up a celestial globe that displays an accurate representation of the ancient Greek constellations (see Figures 1 and 2). This is the oldest surviving depiction of this set of the original Western constellations, and as such can be a valuable resource for studying their early development. The globe places the celestial fi gures against a grid of circles (including the celestial equator, the tropics, the colures, the ecliptic, the Arctic Circle, and the Antarctic Circle) that allows for the accurate positioning of the constellations. The positions shift with time due to precession, so the observed positions on the Farnese Atlas correspond to some particular date. Also, the declination of the Arctic and Antarctic Circles will correspond to a particular latitude for the observer whose observations were adopted by the sculptor. Thus, a detailed analysis of the globe will reveal the latitude and epoch for the observations incorporated in the Atlas; and indeed these will specify enough information that we can identify the observer. Independently, a detailed comparison of the constellation symbols on the Atlas with those from the other surviving ancient material also uniquely points to the same origin for the fi gures. The Farnese Atlas 1 fi rst came to modern attention in the early sixteenth century when it became part of the collection of antiquities in the Farnese Palace in Rome, hence its name. The statue was later transferred to the museum in Naples now called the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli. It is carved in white marble and depicts the bearded Atlas crouched down on one knee with a cloak over his shoulder and holding the celestial globe on his shoulder with both hands. The globe is 65cm in diameter. Its top has a substantial hole knocked into it and this has obliterated the constellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. A total of 41 constellations 2 are depicted, each drawn in positive relief as the classical fi gure, with no individual stars shown. Art historians conclude that the statue is a Roman copy from the second century A.D. of a Greek original dating to before the birth of Christ. 3 What is the date of the observations used for depicting the constellation positions on the Farnese Atlas? A very wide range of plausible answers is possible. First, the Roman sculptor could have updated the constellation positions with his own observations (or those of a contemporary), hence suggesting a date of c. 150 A.D. Second, the Roman sculptor could have used the latest star catalogue to place the constellations accurately onto the coordinate grid of the sky, and this would be from the Almagest of Ptolemy,},

  abstract = {When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42+/-3 micro-as, which is circular and encompasses a central depression in brightness with a flux ratio \textasciitilde 10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is consistent with expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive a central mass of M = (6.5+/-0.7) x 10\^9 Msun. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.},
