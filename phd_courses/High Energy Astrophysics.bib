  abstract = {We use an updated version of SimProp, a Monte Carlo simulation scheme for the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays, to compute cosmogenic neutrino fluxes expected on Earth in various scenarios. These fluxes are compared with the newly detected IceCube events at PeV energies and with recent experimental limits at EeV energies of the Pierre Auger Observatory. This comparison allows us to draw some interesting conclusions about the source models for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We will show how the available experimental observations are almost at the level of constraining such models, mainly in terms of the injected chemical composition and cosmological evolution of sources. The results presented here will also be important in the evaluation of the discovery capabilities of the future planned ultra-high energy cosmic ray and neutrino observatories.},

  abstract = {The search for the origin of cosmic rays is as active as ever, mainly driven by new insights provided by recent pieces of observation. Much effort is being channelled in putting the so called supernova paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays on firmer grounds, while at the highest energies we are trying to understand the observed cosmic ray spectra and mass composition and relating them to potential sources of extragalactic cosmic rays. Interestingly, a topic that has acquired a dignity of its own is the investigation of the transition region between the galactic and extragalactic components, once associated with the ankle and now increasingly thought to be taking place at somewhat lower energies. Here we summarize recent developments in the observation and understanding of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays and we discuss the implications of such findings for the modelling of the transition between the two.},

  abstract = {The discovery of cosmic rays, a milestone in science, was based on the work by scientists in Europe and the New World and took place during a period characterised by nationalism and lack of communication. Many scientists that took part in this research a century ago were intrigued by the penetrating radiation and tried to understand the origin of it. Several important contributions to the discovery of the origin of cosmic rays have been forgotten; historical, political and personal facts might have contributed to their substantial disappearance from the history of science.},
