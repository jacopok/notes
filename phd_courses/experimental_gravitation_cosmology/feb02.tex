\marginpar{Wednesday\\ 2022-2-2}

It's like a xylophone: in each cavity we have several interferometers. 

While it improves a lot when working in a network, 
it can also work alone. 

It is now considered to be a priority for Europe. 
The main sites in competitions are Italy and the Netherlands, and the decision
will be made three years from now. 

Cosmic Explorer is behind Europe, but the Americans are typically fast once
they get their funding. 

This instrument will allow us to look at the Early Universe! 

The rate of BNS mergers \emph{heavily} depends on how efficient the common envelope
phase is at ejecting mass. 

High latitude emission, from components emitted not along the line of sight! 

In GR, GW luminosity distance and EM luminosity distance are the same; 
this may not be true in modified gravity models. 

\todo[inline]{The main uncertainty in this will be on the intrinsic luminosity 
of the GW and EM signals, right? }

LGWA would have been able to detect GW170817 one year before!
