  abstract = {The axion has emerged in recent years as a leading particle candidate to provide the mysterious dark matter in the cosmos, as we review here for a general scientific audience. We describe first the historical roots of the axion in the Standard Model of particle physics and the problem of charge-parity invariance of the strong nuclear force. We then discuss how the axion emerges as a dark matter candidate, and how it is produced in the early Universe. The symmetry properties of the axion dictate the form of its interactions with ordinary matter. Astrophysical considerations restrict the particle mass and interaction strengths to a limited range, which facilitates the planning of experiments to detect the axion. A companion review discusses the exciting prospect that the axion could indeed be detected in the near term in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {We consider the constraints that the available X-ray spectral and imaging data place on the mass distribution and mass-to-light ratio of rich clusters. We find for the best determined cases that the mass-to-light ratio is less than 125 h50 at radii exceeding 1 /i50\_1 Mpc. The mass-to-light ratio is approximately constant at radii exceeding 1 /i50\_1 Mpc but may rise to values of roughly 200 h50 in the central regions. The fraction of the total mass that is in baryons, primarily the hot X-ray emitting gas, is roughly 30\%, thus setting the mass-tolight ratio of the “dark” material to roughly 70. The model that fits the X-ray data for Coma is in good agreement with the observed optical velocity dispersion versus radius data.},

  abstract = {We examine the circular velocity profiles of galaxies in \{\textbackslash Lambda\}CDM cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the EAGLE and LOCAL GROUPS projects and compare them with a compilation of observed rotation curves of galaxies spanning a wide range in mass. The shape of the circular velocity profiles of simulated galaxies varies systematically as a function of galaxy mass, but shows remarkably little variation at fixed maximum circular velocity. This is especially true for low-mass dark matter-dominated systems, reflecting the expected similarity of the underlying cold dark matter haloes. This is at odds with observed dwarf galaxies, which show a large diversity of rotation curve shapes, even at fixed maximum rotation speed. Some dwarfs have rotation curves that agree well with simulations, others do not. The latter are systems where the inferred mass enclosed in the inner regions is much lower than expected for cold dark matter haloes and include many galaxies where previous work claims the presence of a constant density "core". The "cusp vs core" issue is thus better characterized as an "inner mass deficit" problem than as a density slope mismatch. For several galaxies the magnitude of this inner mass deficit is well in excess of that reported in recent simulations where cores result from baryon-induced fluctuations in the gravitational potential. We conclude that one or more of the following statements must be true: (i) the dark matter is more complex than envisaged by any current model; (ii) current simulations fail to reproduce the effects of baryons on the inner regions of dwarf galaxies; and/or (iii) the mass profiles of "inner mass deficit" galaxies inferred from kinematic data are incorrect.},

  abstract = {We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for eight of the brightest dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For Fornax, the dSph with the largest kinematic data set, we obtain a model-independent constraint on the maximum circular velocity, Vmax = 20+−43 km s−1. Although we obtain only lower limits of Vmax 10 km s−1 for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all cases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained and robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive a simple analytic formula that estimates M(rhalf) accurately with respect to results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire population of Local Group dSphs with published kinematic data, we demonstrate a correlation such that M(rhalf) ∝ rh1a.4lf±0.4, or in terms of the mean density interior to the half-light radius, ρ ∝ rh−a1lf.6±0.4. This relation is driven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are unlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass profiles ranging over a factor of 2 in normalization (Vmax ∼ 10–20 km s−1), we consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a “universal” dark matter halo. We show that in addition to the power law M ∝ r1.4, viable candidates include a cuspy “Navarro–Frenk–White” halo with Vmax ∼ 15 km s−1 and scale radius r0 ∼ 800 pc, as well as a cored halo with Vmax ∼ 13 km s−1 and r0 ∼ 150 pc. Finally, assuming that their measured velocity dispersions accurately reflect their masses, the smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph densities at radii as small as a few tens of pc. At these small scales, we find mean densities as large as ρ 5 M pc−3 ( 200 GeV cm−3).},
