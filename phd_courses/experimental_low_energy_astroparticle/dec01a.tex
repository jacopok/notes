Crystals are dense, and typically have a large light yield. 

The light they emit is at reasonable wavelengths. 

It is easier to have contamination when the crystals are grown, though. 

The bandgap for these crystals is very large (\SI{5}{eV} to \SI{10}{eV}), 
so they are typically doped. 

Pulse shape discrimination does not work at the relevant, low energies. 

DAMA saw an annual modulation, but they did not claim it was WIMPs. 
However, they are not sharing their data, which is fishy. 

The relevant unit is the \(\text{dru} = \SI{}{kg^{-1} d^{-1} KeV^{-1}}\). 

\subsection{Bolometers}

These are detectors which measure the heat and phonons emitted by the nuclear recoil. 

Exams: present an experimental technique which was not discussed in detail in the course.
