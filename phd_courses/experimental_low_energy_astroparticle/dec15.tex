\subsection{Bolometers}

\marginpar{Wednesday\\ 2021-12-15}

Bring down a crystal to very low temperature. 

They take a very long time, like \SI{1}{s}, to be restored to 
operating temperature, so they are only useful for rare event searches. 

With tellurium oxide at \SI{10}{mK} 
we can get a capacity of the order of \SI{1}{MeV} per \SI{100}{\micro K}. 

The thermometer must be made by doping a Germanium crystal by a very precise amount, 
what people typically do is to dope through a neutron beam from a nuclear reactor. 

Lead 210 is produced by cosmic rays, and it decays in \SI{22}{yr}. 
So, Roman lead! 

The plot of \(3 \sigma \) discovery against exposure, 
with a knee going from linear to square root: how does it come about?
