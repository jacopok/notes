  abstract = {We present observational confirmation of Hawking's black-hole area theorem based on data from GW150914, finding agreement with the prediction with 97\% (95\%) probability when we model the ringdown including (excluding) overtones of the quadrupolar mode. We obtain this result from a new time-domain analysis of the pre- and postmerger data. We also confirm that the inspiral and ringdown portions of the signal are consistent with the same remnant mass and spin, in agreement with general relativity.},
