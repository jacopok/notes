\section{NS surface tidal forces}

We want to estimate the tidal forces on a \SI{1.6}{m} tall person standing on the surface of a nonrotating neutron star with \(M = 1.4 M_{\odot}\) and \(R = \SI{12}{km}\).\footnote{A first sanity check: the corresponding Schwarzschild radius is around \SI{4}{km}.}

We shall do so by comparing three different methods: Newtonian mechanics, weak-field GR and then full GR (still with the spherical, stationary NR assumption).
The weak-field GR formulation will make the various approximations of the Newtonian approach more explicit. 

\subsection{Newtonian mechanics}

Here, the gravitational acceleration \(a (r)\) looks like 
%
\begin{align}
a (r) = - \frac{GM}{r^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so the differential acceleration between the head and feet of our test person will be 
%
\begin{align}
\Delta a = - \frac{GM}{(r + h)^2} + \frac{GM}{r^2} \approx 2GM \frac{h}{r^3} + \order{ (h / r)^2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
where the scale of the term we are neglecting is \((h / r)^2 \sim (\num{e-4})^2 = \num{e-8}\) --- definitely acceptable for this rough calculation.

With this expression we get \(\Delta a \approx \SI{3.4}{m/s^2}\). 

\subsection{Weak-field GR}

In general, the expression for the geodesic deviation \(a^{\mu }\) corresponding to an observer moving with four-velocity \(u^{\mu }\) described by a space-like vector \(\xi^{\mu }\) is \cite[eq.\ 3.208]{carrollSpacetimeGeometryIntroduction2019}
%
\begin{align}
a^{\mu } = R^{\mu }{}_{\nu \rho \sigma  } u^{\nu } u^{\rho } \xi^{\sigma }
\,.
\end{align}

Our stationary observer on the surface is not moving along a geodesic, but the acceleration due to being stationary in Schwarzschild coordinates is shared by head and feet --- it is the zeroth-order contribution, so to speak. 
The geodesic deviation \(a^{\mu }\) goes directly to the first order. 

In the weak-field approximation, we directly consider the component \(a^{r}\) to estimate \(\abs{\Delta a}\), since we assume (wrongly!) that the metric is not far off from the Minkowski one.
The space-like displacement vector describing the person is \(\xi^{\mu } = h \hat{e}^{r}\), while their four-velocity in this weak-field context is \(u^{\mu } = \hat{e}^{t}\). 

Therefore, the formula simplifies to 
%
\begin{align}
\abs{\Delta a} \approx \abs{a^{r}} = \abs{h R^{r}{}_{ttr} }
\,,
\end{align}
%
and we can approximate this component of the Riemann tensor as such: 
%
\begin{align}
-R^{r}_{ttr} =
+R^{r}_{trt} &= \partial_{r} \Gamma^{r}_{tt} - \underbrace{\partial_t \Gamma^{r}_{rt}}_{\text{zero by stationarity}}
\underbrace{\Gamma^{r}_{r \mu } \Gamma^{\mu }_{tt} - \Gamma^{r}_{t \mu } \Gamma^{\mu}_{r t}}_{\text{second order}}  \\
&\approx \partial_{r} \Gamma^{r}_{tt} = \frac{1}{2} \partial_{r} g^{r \mu } (\underbrace{2\partial_{t} g_{(\mu t)}}_{\text{zero in weak-field}}  - \partial_{\mu } g_{00})  \\
&\approx - \frac{1}{2} \partial_{r} \partial_{r} g_{00} 
\approx \partial_{r} \partial_{r} \Phi  \\
&\approx \partial_{r} \partial_{r} \qty(- \frac{GM}{r}) = \partial_{r} \frac{GM}{r^2} = - \frac{2GM}{r^3}
\,,
\end{align}
%
so our result is exactly the same as the Newtonian one: \(\Delta a = 2GM h / r^3 = \SI{3.4}{m / s^2}\). 

\subsection{Full GR}

Now that we have established the weak-field calculation, let us approach it accounting for the strong-field regime. 

The geodesic deviation equation is still valid, but we must adapt the expressions for \(\xi^{\mu }\) and \(u^{\mu }\): 
we want their moduli to be \(h\) and \(-1\) respectively, and their directions to be \(\hat{e}^{r} \) and \(\hat{e}^{t}\).
In order for this to be true we need to rescale their components as \(\xi^{r} = h / \sqrt{g_{rr}}\) and \(u^{t} = 1/\sqrt{g_{tt}}\). 

Also, we cannot only compute \(a^{r}\): we must consider the full vector \(a^{\mu }\) and compute its modulus \(\sqrt{a^{\mu } a_\mu }\). 
Notice the lowered index: the component \(a^{r}\) appears in the modulus of the acceleration as \(a^{r} \sqrt{g_{rr}}\), and \(\sqrt{g_{rr}} \approx \num{1.23}\) is noticeably different from 1 in this situation. 

This way, we have all the components to plug into a computer algebra system like Cadabra: 
the acceleration comes out to have \(a^{r}\) as its only nonvanishing component, 
%
\begin{align}
a^{r} = \frac{1}{r} \frac{h}{r} \frac{2GM}{r} \qty(1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2})^{-1/2}
\,,
\end{align}
%
whose modulus is then 
%
\begin{align}
\abs{a} = a^{r} \sqrt{g_{rr}} = \frac{2GMh}{r^3} 
\,,
\end{align}
%
which, incidentally, is proportional to the square root of the Kretschmann scalar \(K = R^{\mu \nu \rho \sigma } R_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma } \propto G^2M^2c^{-4} r^{-6}\). 

This is the same result we found in the weak field regime! 
The components from the metric cancelled out.
