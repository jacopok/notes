Discussion on the gravitational instability, looking at the fluid velocity, 
which is the derivative of \(d = a r\), where \(r\) is comoving. 

Since the total time derivative of \(f(r, t)\) must be the same 
we would get with \(f(x, t)\), we must have 
%
\begin{align}
\eval{\pdv{f}{t}}_{x= \text{const}} =
\eval{\pdv{f}{t}}_{r= \text{const}} - 
H (\vec{r} \cdot \vec{\nabla}_r) f
\,.
\end{align}
